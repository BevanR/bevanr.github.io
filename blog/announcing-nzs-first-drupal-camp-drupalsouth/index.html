        I'm Bevan Rudge

  I'm a web technologist and software engineer.

  I've been building the web since 2002.

  I am most satisfied when I solve problems through engineering, share my skills by mentoring, and craft beautiful experiences for my other people.

<p><a href=http://drupalsouth.net.nz/organisers>Together with some friends and colleagues</a> we have been working hard to organise, finalize and publish details of what will be the two most important days for Drupal in New Zealand:</p>
<h3>DrupalSouth: The New Zealand Drupal Event for 2008</h3>
<p><a href=http://drupalsouth.net.nz style=float:right><img src=http://drupalsouth.net.nz/sites/drupalsouth/files/lightfantastic_logo.png alt="DrupalSouth logo: The DrupliKiwiFruit"></a> <a href=http://drupalsouth.net.nz>DrupalSouth</a> is the New Zealand Drupal Event for 2008. DrupalSouth will bring NZ's Drupal community together for the first nation-wide Drupal event and the first ever Drupal camp in NZ.</p>
<p>DrupalSouth runs for two days in the first weekend of November, starting at 9:30 am on Saturday 1st November and concluding at 6 pm on Sunday 2nd November 2008. The morning of each day will be filled with presentations, while the afternoons will be open to less formal talks, discussions, demonstrations, tutorials and hacking.</p>
<p>I will be presenting on <a href=http://drupalsouth.net.nz/session/google-maps-in-drupal-the-hub-map>Google Maps in Drupal; The Hub Map</a>, in which I will showcase <a href=http://hub.witness.org/map#full-screen>the Hub Map</a>, and talk about implementing Google maps mashups in Drupal.</p>
<p>Many of <a href=http://drupalsouth.net.nz/speakers>the speakers</a> are well-established Drupal and Open-Source community contributers like <a href=http://drupalsouth.net.nz/profile/dman>Dan "dman"</a>, <a href=http://drupalsouth.net.nz/profile/shiny>Brenda "Shiny" Wallace</a>, <a href=http://drupalsouth.net.nz/profile/marekkuziel>Marek Kuziel</a> (Open ID, Python, Postgres) and myself. Others have won <acronym title="New Zealand Open Source Society">NZOSS</acronym> awards for their contributions to Open Source, like <a href=http://drupalsouth.net.nz/profile/joshcampbell>Joshua Campbell</a> and <a href=http://drupalsouth.net.nz/profile/dave>Dave Lane</a>.</p>
<p>The awesome line up of presenters will present on <a href=http://drupalsouth.net.nz/programme>a variety of topics</a>, such as <a href=http://drupalsouth.net.nz/session/drupal-vs-the-rest>How Drupal stacks up in enterprise</a>, and <a href=http://drupalsouth.net.nz/session/openid-with-drupal>OpenID and Drupal</a> to name just a couple.</p>
<p>DrupalSouth presents a great opportunity for attendees to learn new and interesting Drupal skills, techniques and resources, network face to face with industry leaders and Drupal professionals, companies and users, engage new clients, employees and contractors, discover how others are using Drupal or promote their own company or services.</p>
<p>If you do anything with Drupal, you oughta be there!</p>

        I'm Bevan Rudge

  I'm a web technologist and software engineer.

  I've been building the web since 2002.

  I am most satisfied when I solve problems through engineering, share my skills by mentoring, and craft beautiful experiences for my other people.

  I have expert skills in ECMAScript (JavaScript), TypeScript and Vue. I am also skilled with SQL, Python, Golang, PHP and more.

<p>I'm really looking forward to <a href=http://boston2008.drupalcon.org>DrupalCon Boston 2008</a>. The highlight for me will likely be meeting a bunch of really great people I have come to know, respect and be inspired by;</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone at <a href=http://civicactions.com>CivicActions</a>; My awesome colleagues and team-mates for the last 6 months.</li>
<li>Dries Buytaert; For obvious reasons.</li>
<li>Karoly Chx Negyesi; It's been great having your support on <a href=http://groups.drupal.org/season-usability title="Season of Usability">SoU</a>. I want to put a voice to your words, code-comments and even php code!</li>
<li>Folk from the <a href=http://groups.drupal.org/usability>Usability Group</a>; Eigentor, Gaele, SteveJB, Yoroy, CousinHub and many others.</li>
<li>Neil Drumm; You're usability discussion at BADcamp (I listened to the podcast) was inspiring and interesting for me.</li>
<li>Kent Bye; You have contributed a lot of videos and screenshots that have been inspiring for me. Then there's <a href=http://drupal.org/project/backtrace_visualizer>Backtrace Vizualizer</a> which is just amazing.</li>
<li>Angie Webchick Byron; You're never-ending support is inspiring and motivating. Where do you get all that energy from?</li>
<li>And too many others to list here...</li>
</ul>
<p>I leave this coming Sunday night (in less than 6 days) for <abbr title="San Francisco">Frisko</abbr> via <acronym title=Auckland>AKL</acronym> and <acronym title="Los Angeles">LAX</acronym>, where I'll overnight. I go onto Minneapolis on Monday for the <a href=http://groups.drupal.org/node/7929>usability testing at the <acronym title="University of Minnesota">UMN</acronym></a>, where I'll arrive in time, albeit a bit late, for the <a href=http://groups.drupal.org/node/8648>Twin-cities drupal meetup</a> with Dries, the 'usability team' and local drupal folk.</p>
<p>On Friday 29th, it's off to Boston. I'm still looking for something to do for the weekend. I was thinking of heading to <abbr title="New York City">NYC</abbr> to see the big apple, Montreal Canada just cause I've never been there, Vermont for a day's riding the slopes, or maybe hanging out in Boston to site-see, see if I can open a US bank account, and maybe scratch my apple-itch helping the <a href=http://www.raincitystudios.com/blogs-and-pods/steve-krueger/drupalcon-boston-iphoneunlockcon>RCS folk unlock or brick their iPhones</a>.</p>
<p>Monday 3rd of course brings on <a href=http://boston2008.drupalcon.org>the Main Event</a>. Saturday 8th sees me on a plane back to Frisko for the night. On Sunday 9th I'll have most of the day free to site-see before getting on a plane home to Christchurch on Sunday evening.</p>

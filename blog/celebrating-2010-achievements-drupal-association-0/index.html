<p>2010 has been a big year for the <a href=http://association.drupal.org/>Drupal Association</a>. Early in the year <a href=http://association.drupal.org/node/478>new members were brought on and the Board of Directors saw some changes</a>. But most noteworthy is what the Drupal Association did for the Drupal community;</p>
<p><a href=http://drupal.org/><img width=549 height=548 style=display:block;margin:auto alt="Screenshot of the newly redesigned Drupal.org." src=http://drupal.geek.nz/files/Drupal.org-redesign.png></a></p>
<h3>Drupal.org Redesign Completion</h3>
<p>Drupal.org has a new look and feel. If you have not seen it (have you been under a rock!?) go <a href=http://drupal.org/>check out Drupal.org</a> right now!</p>
<p>It took a few years and many iterations and volunteers, and even that was not enough. This year the <a href=http://association.drupal.org/node/609>Drupal Association came to the party with funding to finish the job</a>. Contracts went to tender and were won by <a href=http://delocalizedham.com/>Neil Drumm</a>, <a href=http://www.achieveinternet.com/>Achieve Internet</a> and <a href=http://3281d.com/>3281d Consulting</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who contributed to the Drupal.org redesign for all your hard work and effort to pull this off. And especially thank you to the Drupal Association for funding the last several miles that could not be covered by volunteers alone.</p>
<p>Drupal.org will never be the same again! Find out <a href=http://association.drupal.org/node/724>what is next for Drupal.org</a>.</p>
<h3>DrupalCon San Francisco</h3>
<p><a style=float:right;margin-left:1em href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/ceardach/4540466252/ title="See photo on Flickr.com"><img width=256 height=296 alt="Photo of chx with a large DrupalCon San Francisco logo on the projector screen behind him." src=http://drupal.geek.nz/files/DrupalCon-SF-chx.jpg><br>

</a></p>
<p>How could we ever forget? <a href=http://sf2010.drupal.org/>DrupalCon San Francisco</a>, was epic. By all measures, it was the largest and most spectacular Drupal event yet.</p>
<p>The Drupal Association bootstrapped the funding and locked in critical contracts in order to secure the venue and other services. Many of the DrupalCon San Francisco committee members also serve the Drupal Association. The Drupal Association managed all the finances for the event and coordinated the local team and service providers with the rest of the Drupal community.</p>
<p>And that is just the beginning of what the Drupal Association did to make DrupalCon San Francisco a reality!</p>
<h3 style=clear:both>Git Migration</h3>
<p><a style=float:right;margin-left:1em href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/hefox/4552076774/ title="See photo on Flickr.com"><img width=256 height=385 alt="Photo of Sam Boyer posing with a Druplipet on his head." src=http://drupal.geek.nz/files/sam-boyer-drupalcon-sf.jpg><br>

</a></p>
<p>The Drupal Association recognized the urgency to update <a href=http://drupalcode.org/viewvc/drupal/>Drupal.org's version control system (currently CVS)</a>.</p>
<p>Drupal has an active, amazingly awesome and amiable community. One of the reasons for this, is that <a href=http://drupal.org/>Drupal.org</a> is our home. It has everything Drupal developers need, all in one place. However the last couple of years has seen a trend for contributions to be distributed elsewhere.</p>
<p>The Drupal Association realised that if Drupal.org did not offer modern version control and code-distribution tools, then Drupal.org would cease to be a central repository for contributed Drupal code. And that would ultimately be damaging to the community and the project.</p>
<p><a style=float:left;margin-right:1em title="Go to Git-scm.org" href=http://git-scm.com/><img width=97 height=188 alt="Git logo" src=http://drupal.geek.nz/files/git-logo.png></a></p>
<p>So earlier this year, <a href=http://association.drupal.org/node/609>the Drupal Association hired Sam Boyer</a> to work on detailed planning and foundation work in preparation for the migration of <a href=http://drupalcode.org/viewvc/drupal/>Drupal's gigantic CVS repository</a>, including about 9000 contributed themes modules and other projects, to <a href=http://git-scm.com/>Git</a>.</p>
<p>This work is underway and is making good progress, but has some way to go yet. Sam is leading the effort but the success of the project is highly dependent on volunteer effort too. You can <a href=http://groups.drupal.org/drupal-org-git-migration-team>get involved on g.d.o</a>.</p>
<h3 style=clear:both>Paid Staff</h3>
<p>Early in the year, <a href=http://association.drupal.org/node/553>Treasurer Jacob Redding was hired as full-time General Manager</a> for the Drupal Association. More recently, <a href=http://association.drupal.org/node/739>the Drupal Association hired Neil Kent as a Events Manager and Megan Sanicki as Sponsor Wrangler (Fundraising Manager)</a>.</p>
<p>Jacob does a wide range of tasks including managing financial assets and tasks, lawyers, accountants, contracts, bills, Drupal Association meetings and boot load of other tasks that arise.</p>
<p><a href=http://association.drupal.org/user/Neil_Kent>Neil</a> is working hard on a range of administrative, logistic and financial tasks related to <a href=http://cph2010.drupal.org/>DrupalCon Copenhagen 2010</a> and <a href=http://chicago2011.drupal.org/>DrupalCon Chicago 2011</a>, as well as trying to document it all and make DrupalCon production more sustainable, so that it is not so much work to reproduce DrupalCon in a new location every 6 months.</p>
<p><a href=http://association.drupal.org/user/Megan_Sanicki>Megan</a> is working on raising funds and managing relationships with past, future and potential sponsors, for both DrupalCon and other projects of the Drupal Association. She is also exploring new avenues of revenue.</p>
<p>These funds allow the Association to;</p>
<ul>
<li>pay salaries of staff</li>
<li>fund hardware that keeps Drupal.org online</li>
<li>fund projects like the Drupal.org redesign and the Git migration</li>
<li>pay contractors to keep Drupal's websites up to date, secure and useful to the community</li>
</ul>
<p>Megan's, Neil's and Jacob's responsibilities are critical to the health of the Drupal Association. Which is in turn, critical to the Drupal community and the resources they depend upon, such as Drupal.org and many other infrastructure services.</p>
<h3>Legal and Financial Achievements</h3>
<p>Through the careful management of Jacob Redding, the Drupal Association has managed to achieve all of this with less than 25% overhead. That is incredibly low for any non-profit or trade organisation.</p>
<p>DrupalCon Inc. received its <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)>501c3 (not for profit) status</a>, which allowed tens of thousands of dollars to be put right back into the Drupal community. This was a major process to work through the processes of the <a href=http://www.irs.gov/>Internal Revenue Service</a> agency of the US government.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Drupal Association;</p>
<ul>
<li>got payment time for invoices down to less than 30 days (from more than 60)</li>
<li>turned over more than a million US dollars</li>
<li>registered for tax purposes in four countries</li>
<li>was a fiscal agent for 3 major DrupalCamps in the US; <a href=http://groups.drupal.org/nyc/drupalcampnyc8>NYC</a>, <a href=http://drupalcampcolorado.org/>Colorado</a> and <a href=https://www.chicagodrupalcamp.org/>Chicago</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
<p>Another important achievement of 2010 was updating our mission statement. We began this process <a href=http://association.drupal.org/node/538>in April in San Francisco at our full-day-long meeting</a>, then iterated on it over the following months to reach the final wording. </p>
<p>You can read more about the process and work that went into the missions statement in <a href=http://association.drupal.org/node/669>this blog post by Robert Douglass</a>. Or you can just skip to <a href=http://association.drupal.org/about>the result</a>;</p>
<blockquote><h4><strong>Mission Statement</strong></h4>
<p> The Drupal Association fosters and supports the Drupal software project, the community and its growth.</p>
<h4><strong>The Drupal Association does this by:</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>Maintaining the hardware and software infrastructure of Drupal.org and other community sites.</li>
<li>Empowering the Drupal community to participate in and contribute to the project.</li>
<li>Protecting the GPL source code of the Drupal project and its community contributions.</li>
<li>Protecting the Drupal project and community through legal work and advocacy.</li>
<li>Organizing and promoting worldwide events.</li>
<li>Communicating the benefits of the Drupal software.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The mission statement helps guide the Drupal Association in it's decision-making, and makes it clear to the community what the Drupal Association does and does not do.</p>
<h3>Priorities</h3>
<p>Another of the main outcomes of the <a href=http://association.drupal.org/node/538>full-day-long meeting in San Francisco</a> was a list of the five highest priority goals;</p>
<ol>
<li>Completing the implementation of the Drupal.org redesign</li>
<li>Continuing to build a sustainable model for DrupalCons</li>
<li>Improving internal processes and decision-making</li>
<li>Hiring permanent staff to help the DA better execute on its initiatives</li>
<li>Improving the technical infrastructure of drupal.org</li>
</ol>
<p>We completed items 1 and 4. Double yay!</p>
<p>We made excellent progress on item 2, including hiring an Events Manager and <a href=http://association.drupal.org/rfps/drupalcon>outsourcing website development</a> to <a href=http://growingventuresolutions.com/>Growing Venture Solutions</a>. However scaling the production of 3000-person bi-annual events is a large project that will take time and never be completely finished.</p>
<p>Similarly, item 5 is never really "done". Maintaining Drupal.org hardware, software and infrastructure is a never-ending job that volunteers work at tirelessly and with very little thanks from the hundreds of thousands of members and visitors to Drupal.org. The Drupal Association applauds their hard work and thanks them sincerely. The Drupal Association funds some of this work from time to time when volunteered time is not sufficient, and also pays for hardware and expenses required for the task.</p>
<p>As for item 3, the mission statement is one significant achievement towards this goal, but there is a lot more to it than that. Additionally, the Drupal Association has hired a consultant experienced with non-profit organisations to help us determine changes to structure that will help us achieve this goal. We are looking forward to report the changes that we decide to implement and how this will improve the efficiency of the Drupal Association to better serve the Drupal community.</p>
<h3>Thank <strong>You</strong>!</h3>

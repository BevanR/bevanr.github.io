<p>Almost a month ago I blogged about <a href=http://drupal.geek.nz/node/55>how much spam I receive</a>. At that time it was around one spam email per 100 seconds (average over the previous month). Since then I've updated my <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pTpwkDap5YFcnDJ5RRAlIRw">crude spam rate tracker</a> twice and I'm now receiving approximately one spam every 90 seconds. If you look at the numbers carefully you'll noticed that today's count was <em>less</em> for all mailboxes <em>except</em> one; N L AR, the catch-all address for lucion.com.ar. The spam count for that mailbox increased dramatically from about 1000 to almost 4000. Most interestingly, I received almost <strong>150 automated replies to spam messages from unused @lucion.com.ar addresses</strong>:</p>
<p><a href=http://drupal.geek.nz/files/lucion-christmas-mail2_0.png title="click for large image"><img src=http://drupal.geek.nz/files/lucion-christmas-mail2_0.png height=400 alt="screenshot of mailbox with many automated replies to spam emails from unused @lucion.com.ar addresses"></a></p>
<p>It would seem that a spammer is targeting lucion.com.ar as both a fictitious <code>from</code> address for their outgoing spam, and a spam recipient. Why would lucion.com.ar be targeted? Does anyone know how to foil this targeted spam? Should I turn off catch-all? Set up SPF?</p>
<p>I've also started receiving comment spam on this blog. Probably average about 3 per day -- all of the same style; usinge BB-code, random letters as titles and usernames and probably from the same botnet (they're from many unrelated IPs). Since I'm running this on drupal 6 RC1 I haven't put up any anti-spam defenses other than having all comments moderated. I assume that most or all of the best anti-comment spam contrib modules have not yet been ported to drupal 6. Are there any?</p>

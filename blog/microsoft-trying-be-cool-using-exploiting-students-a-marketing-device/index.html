        I'm Bevan Rudge

  I'm a web technologist and software engineer.

  I've been building the web since 2002.

  I am most satisfied when I solve problems through engineering, share my skills by mentoring, and craft beautiful experiences for my other people.

  I have expert skills in ECMAScript (JavaScript), TypeScript and Vue. I am also skilled with SQL, Python, Golang, PHP and more.

<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p> My name is Janina Voigt and I am one of the three Microsoft Student<br>
Partners for 2008. The other Student Partners are Yugan Yugaraja and<br>
Mayur Sampat.<br>
Our role is to bridge the gap between students and academics at<br>
Canterbury, and Microsoft.</p>
<p> We will be carrying out presentations and/or workshops throughout the<br>
year on a variety of topics such as .NET Framework, C#, Popfly,<br>
Silverlight, XNA and Visual Studio 2008. We will also be supporting<br>
Microsoft student events in Christchurch such as Student Day and we are<br>
also looking to organise a few social events such as an XBOX360 night<br>
and Quiz night.</p>
<p> The first of our presentations will be next Tuesday (18th of March)<br>
from<br>
12-1 in room 315 in the Cosc building . In this presentation, we will<br>
introduce Popfly, which can be used to create some cool gadgets on the<br>
internet. No programming experience is required, so even if this is your<br>
first year, you should come along and check it out. There will be some<br>
cool prizes, including a copy Microsoft Office 2007 Professional, and<br>
free chocolate for everyone.</p>
<p> If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to<br>
contact us at: <a href=mailto:mssrep@cosc.canterbury.ac.nz>mssrep@cosc.canterbury.ac.nz</a></p>
<p> And remember to check out our blog: <a href=http://mspcanty.spaces.live.com/ title=http://mspcanty.spaces.live.com/>http://mspcanty.spaces.live.com/</a></p>

<p>Yay! Free chocolate to suck on Microsoft's [marketing campaign]. If there's free chocolate I'll definitely go!</p>

<p>Not.</p>
<p>This is my first year at the University of Canterbury as a COSC student. I'm doing a couple of second year papers after having done 1st year CS papers at Massey last year. Is Microsoft normally this persistent?</p>
<p>On a funny side note, one of the biggest computer labs at uni is full of iMacs, all running XP. It's creepy:</p>

<p> Hey everyone,</p>
<p> My name is Raffael and I am not one of the three Microsoft Student<br>
Partners for 2008. I want to introduce you to the Free Culture Club. Our<br>
belief is to be free to study, understand, participate in and build upon<br>
the culture that surrounds us. We will highlight the benefits of Free<br>
and Open Source Software over proprietary software, and restrictive<br>
licences that aim to lock down culture and control our interaction with<br>
it.</p>
<p> We might prepare some presentations and workshops[1], but much more we<br>
want to inspire your mind, support students and clubs, artists and<br>
writers -- we want to share creativity and work together.</p>
<p> Help us to make a difference at the University of Canterbury. Share your<br>
ideas with us at <a href=mailto:freeculture@cosc.canterbury.ac.nz>freeculture@cosc.canterbury.ac.nz</a> or come to our<br>
fortnightly meeting. Our next meetings are:<br>
Tuesday, March 18th, 5pm (tomorrow) and<br>
Tuesday, April 1st, 5pm in the<br>
"Student Hub" (Psychology Building)</p>
<p> For more information check our website:<br>

<p> Cheers,<br>

OpenOffice.org, from Internet Explorer to Firefox, and from Windows to<br>
free Operating Systems like Ubuntu and other flavours of GNU/Linux.</p>

<p> "There has never been a time in history when more of our 'culture' was<br>
as 'owned' as it is now. And yet there has never been a time when the<br>
concentration of power to control the /uses/ of culture has been as<br>
unquestioningly accepted as it is now." --Lawrence Lessig "Free Culture"<br>

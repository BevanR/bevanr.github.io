        I'm Bevan Rudge

  I'm a web technologist and software engineer.

  I've been building the web since 2002.

  I am most satisfied when I solve problems through engineering, share my skills by mentoring, and craft beautiful experiences for my other people.

  I have expert skills in ECMAScript (JavaScript), TypeScript and Vue. I am also skilled with SQL, Python, Golang, PHP and more.

<h1>Software Engineering code of conduct</h1>
</div>
<p>This is an answer to a question I wrote for an old 1st year computer science paper in preparation for an exam. I put a fair bit of effort into and thought it was worth sharing. The Question was something a long the lines of "Give your opinions on the following statement; Employers should require software engineers to accept a code of ethics and professional conduct."</p>
<blockquote><p>Software Engineers, can not be forced and should not be expected to accept any code of ethics or code of professional conduct.</p>
<p>It is not necessary that SEs accept such a code. Any such code, as objective as it may be intended, is - by nature - subjective. Therefore it is to be expected that SEs as individuals shall disagree on details of such a code.</p>
<p>Further, it is unfair to expect an individual SE to conform to a code they disagree with. Such an expectation should only be placed on any individual by trusted authorities through laws that aim to provide for a safe and fair society.</p>
<p>Agreement on the majority of such a code by the majority of SEs, is however a fair expectation, if and only if such a code is as objective as reasonable possibly. By this, an objective code will have been contributed to by a wide diversity of SEs.</p>
<p>Disagreement with the parts code of does not make the SE bad, irresponsible or incompetent. However the more a SE disagrees with an objective code, the more their ability to take responsibility for their efforts and their competence as a SE is questionable.</p></blockquote>

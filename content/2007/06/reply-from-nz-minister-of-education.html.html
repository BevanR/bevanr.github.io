    <p>A <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/05/29/0152250">slashdot posting</a> a while back got me <a href="http://trinity.neooffice.org/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=4444">writing a couple of letters</a><br>
and getting involved at the NeoOffice forums.  This morning I got a <a href="http://bevan.rudge.net.nz/files/MOE-Steve_Maharey.pdf">reply signed by Mr Steve Maharey</a>, NZ Minister of Education, himself.  Although it has his signature, I suspect that he didn't actually write it -- although he hopefully read my email and the reply.</p>
<p>Things are sounding positive for open source in education in NZ.</p>

    <div class="content">I was involved in this project.  I worked on google maps integration to capture and display geodata for users, videos, events, campaigns and boilt down to <a href="http://hub.witness.org/map">the Hub Map</a>.  From CivicActions' launch post;
<blockquote><p>Last Wednesday, CivicActions launched the <a target="new" href="http://hub.witness.org/">WITNESS Video Hub</a>.</p>
<p><a target="new" href="http://www.witness.org/">WITNESS</a> uses video and online technologies to open the eyes of the world to human rights violations. In their 15 years, they have mostly helped on-the-ground organizations document human rights violations by providing cameras and support to document these violations. A few years ago, they saw the possibilities and the inevitability of user-generated video, and thus began planning The Hub: a grassroots-driven, participatory media website that enables anyone anywhere in the world with access to the internet to upload, share, discuss and take action around human rights-related media and resources. Through the Hub, organizations, networks and groups around the world are able to bring their human rights stories and campaigns to global attention.</p>
<p>Working with the incredible team at WITNESS, CivicActions built a core video upload, conversion, and playback suite for the Drupal content management system, called <a target="new" href="http://drupal.org/project/media_mover">Media Mover</a>. With Media Mover as the base, the site provides a comprehensive vocabulary around geography and issues, allowing users to connect immediately by uploading and watching relevant videos, and then joining groups and campaigns around the world.</p>

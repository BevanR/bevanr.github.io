    <p>This one come's from a great article from humanized about   <a href="http://humanized.com/weblog/2007/10/05/make_oss_humane/">usability in floss</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>User errors are a sign that the interface is inhumane, not that the users are dumb. To dismiss these errors as signs of user stupidity is to ignore the very information that should be telling you how to improve the design. “The status quo is good enough” is not an attitude that has ever lead to progress.</p></blockquote>

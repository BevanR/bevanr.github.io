    <blockquote><p>11:25AM: "[You] introduced multitouch on iPhone, what about for the Mac?"</p>
<p>Steve: "Makes sense for the iPhone, not sure it makes sense in the Mac. Classify that as a research project."</p>

<p>WTF?   How can such usability revolutionists not realize the potential of putting multi-touch technology on the desktop?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKh1Rv0PlOQ">Jeff Han's demo</a> publicized this concept over six months ago, Microsoft has already started doing it the wrong way with with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/">Microsoft Surface</a>, and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/07/microsoft-announces-the-hp-touchsmart-pc/">HP bet everyone</a> to the store a few months back.  Even <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2007/07/linux_mpx_multitouch_table_may.html">linux has made steps</a> in that direction.</p>
<p>I can not think of any argument as to why this technology is not beneficial to the user experience and usability.  In fact I believe this technology would make the home computer usable for even the clumsiest technology-fearing grandma.</p>
<p>I can only think of a few possibilities;</p>
<ol>
<li>Jobs is bluffing to hide Apple's next big announcement (MacWorld '08?)</li>
<li>Apple has technical problems with the technology and they won't admit it</li>
<li>Apple and/or Jobs have lost the plot, or a just slow of the mark.</li>
</ol>
<p>I fear number 3.  2 is certainly possible, although I can't think what problems.  I hope it's number 1 -- that sort of tactic is certainly common with Apple product releases.</p>
<p>Ideas?</p>

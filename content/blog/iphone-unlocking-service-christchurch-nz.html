    <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: I no longer offer this service.</p>
<h2>Original blog post follows...</h2>
<p>Due to high rank in google search results for <a href="http://www.google.co.nz/search?q=upgrade+iphone&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryNZ">queries about unlocked iPhone upgrades to v2 firmware</a> and my recent <a href="http://drupal.geek.nz/blog/upgrade-unlocked-jail-broken-first-generation-iphone-v2-iphone-firmware">article about my own experiences</a>.  A number of people in Christchurch have contacted me about unlocking their first-generation iPhones that have become locked after upgrading.  This is not my trade, and is not something I would consider myself a professional in.  However I am confident enough to do this without bricking (rendering it permanently useless) the phone.</p>
<p>While I'd prefer to <a href="http://blog.iphone-dev.org/">help others to do it themselves</a>, I understand this is too much to learn or too overwhelming for many people.  <del>If you would like me to unlock your iPhone, please contact me</del>.  These are my terms;</p>
<ul>
<li>I will not assume liability for any permanent damage that may occur as a result of attempting to unlock your iPhone.</li>
<li>You must agree to not holding me liable for any permanent damage that may occur as a result of attempting to unlock your iPhone.</li>
<li>The fee is a flat fee of NZD 250.</li>
<li>I can not offer a receipt or guarantee.  Although I have never failed to deliver.</li>
<li>You are responsible for delivery and pickup up, or otherwise suitable shipping.</li>
</ul>

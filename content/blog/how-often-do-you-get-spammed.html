    <p>I get spammed approximately every 103 seconds.  Really.  Here are my numbers and calculations; <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pTpwkDap5YFcnDJ5RRAlIRw" title="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pTpwkDap5YFcnDJ5RRAlIRw">http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pTpwkDap5YFcnDJ5RRAlIRw</a></p>
<p>The mailboxes collectively include several catch-all's and many webmaster@ postmaster@ and abuse@ email addresses.  I used to publish my email addresses online fairly liberally.  Some of the email addresses are several years old and are probably on every single spam-mailing-list.</p>
<p>How many spam emails do you get?</p>

    <p>I researched and compared travel insurances that include cover for backcountry ski touring for 28 days in Canada for a NZ-resident couple in their thirties.  Most travel insurers exclude skiing outside of the ski area, or off-piste.  These are the options I found.  Most also offer annual options which are comparable to 4-week single trips.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> For a small claim, Tugo Insurance took 9 months of processing and achieved nothing.  I recommend avoiding this company.</p>
<ul>
<li>Premium: CAD $141.96 for emergency medical only, with default deductible (excess) of $150 and medical sum insured (a limit) of $50,000</li>
<li>Destinations: Canada, some short transit stops</li>
<li>Policy: <a href="http://www.alpineclubofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/TuGoPolicyWording-English.pdf" title="http://www.alpineclubofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/TuGoPolicyWording-English.pdf">http://www.alpineclubofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/TuGoPolicyWo...</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Best price by a large margin, but it excludes non-medical cover.  The medical part covers accident, injury, sickness, evacuation, rescue, medical fees, hospitalisation, follow ups, repatriation, and accompaniment.  This makes it a good insurance to supplement any existing travel insurance to get cover for backcountry touring.</p>

<p>Bupa seems to have a pretty comprehensive policy.  I read the whole document.  It also covers professionals, including athletes and guides.  Apparently Nitro Circus athletes have this insurance!</p>

<p>I investigated this one least thoroughly.  I recommend calling to ask and confirm how they differentiate "mountaineering" from backcountry touring.  You should also read the whole policy document (as with any insurance).  I only searched it.</p>

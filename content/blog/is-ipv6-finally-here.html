    <p>"On February 4th, IANA will add AAAA records for the IPv6 addresses of the four root servers." <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/01/03/1954245" title="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/01/03/1954245">http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/01/03/1954245</a></p>
<p>Does that mean IPv6 is finally happening?  I guess it's time to make sure your web host supports IPv6, or switch to one that does.</p>

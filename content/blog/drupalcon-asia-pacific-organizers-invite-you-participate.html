    <p>We are excited to announce the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/drupalcon-asiapacific-regional-organising-group">DrupalCon Asia-Pacific Organisers group</a>.  DCAPO intends to lay foundations that will facilitate international Drupal Conferences (DrupalCons) in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

<p>DCAPO welcomes and needs input and assistance from Drupal users and communities throughout the Asia-Pacific region.  DrupalCons are a lot of work, and are only possible through the community's effort.  Please <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/drupalcon-asiapacific-regional-organising-group">join the DCAPO group</a> to share your opinions and experience, volunteer your time, or nominate yourself or others for roles on the selection team.</p>

<p>DCAPO will later announce a call to the community to suggest and research locations for the first Asia-Pacific DrupalCon.  Note that a lot of work goes into researching locations.  The DCAPO selection team will only be able to seriously consider locations with suitable venues, dates and event management companies, financial estimates, potential audience and motivated local teams.</p>

<p>But first, as much of the Asia-Pacific Drupal community as possible needs to get involved.  You can help by translating and reposting this announcement on other websites where Asia-Pacific Drupal users and communities are likely to find it.  Don't forget to <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/34658">note any translations and reposts in the DCAPO group</a> so that we can track progress and share translations with each other.</p>

<p>DCAPO is a result of the <a href="http://association.drupal.org/">Drupal Association</a>'s new <a href="http://association.drupal.org/node/342">Events Plan</a> (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/574502">announced on Drupal.org</a>) to have an Asia-Pacific DrupalCon every two years.</p>

<p>Thank you! <br>
From the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/drupalcon-asiapacific-regional-organising-group">DrupalCon Asia-Pacific Organisers group</a></p>

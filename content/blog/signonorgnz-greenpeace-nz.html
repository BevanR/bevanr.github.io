    <p>Earlier this year <a href="http://civicactions.com/team/jennsramek">Jenn</a>, <a href="http://civicactions.com/team/owenbarton">Owen</a> and <a href="http://civicactions.com/team/bevan_rudge">I</a> worked on a proposal for <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/?nz">Greenpeace NZ</a>.  CivicActions didn't win the contract, but the website has just launched.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.signon.org.nz/join-me/77782406">SignOn.org.nz</a> – a <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> site – was implemented by <a href="http://www.catalyst.net.nz/">Catalyst IT</a>, a <acronym title="Free/Libre &amp; Open Source Software">FLOSS</acronym> software shop in Wellington New Zealand which employs <a href="http://drupal.org/user/188162">Josh "fiasco" Waihi</a>, Drupal 7 PostgreSQL maintainer and <a href="http://www.itrockstar.co.nz/winner/">NZ IT Rockstar 2009 winner</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/user/31033">Brenda "shiny" Wallace</a>, Drupal contributor.</p>

<p>Catalyst has done an excellent job and the campaign was <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/features/2434108/The-new-face-of-environmental-activism">featured in NZ's national Sunday newspaper a couple of weeks ago</a>.</p>

<p>They've got many <a href="http://www.signon.org.nz/community/high-profile">Kiwi celebrities</a> on for the campaign, some which are known internationally too;  Most notably Lucy Lawless (Xena Warrior Princess) and Keisha Castle Hughes (From <em>Whale Rider</em> and award-winning other films).</p>

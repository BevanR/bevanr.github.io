    <p>This is why patents are ridiculous;<br>
<i><br>
</i></p><blockquote><i>On Tuesday, the USPTO granted Microsoft a patent for <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=7,269,853">privacy policy change notification</a>, which describes how to <a href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1064/1358325795_2545188f44_o.jpg">threaten users with the loss of their accounts</a> and access to web sites and services should they refuse to consent to changes in a privacy policy. This includes the case where a user might object to allowing personal information, collected earlier with a promise of confidentiality, to be shared in the future with third parties. Also described is a 'Never Notify Me' option so you won't have to 'worry' over privacy policy changes.</i></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Isn't the patent system supposed to protect <span style="font-weight: bold;">innovative</span> ideas?</p>

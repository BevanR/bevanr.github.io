    <p>My <a href="http://drupal.org/node/180425">largest code contribution</a> to Drupal core just got committed!  :)  At last <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/function/node_teaser">node_teaser()</a> can take a rest -- at least for a while anyway.  It looks like there'll be <a href="http://drupal.org/node/190374">another round of work</a> on it for Drupal 7).</p>
<p>This was partially sponsored by <a href="http://civicactions.com/">CivicActions</a> and was a result of work on <a href="http://justcauseit.com/">JustCauseIt.com</a>.  Massive kudos to <a href="http://drupal.org/user/80140">Giles</a> for his extensive testing on this.</p>

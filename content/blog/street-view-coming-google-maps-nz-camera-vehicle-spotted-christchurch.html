    <p style="font-weight:bold; font-size:120%;">UPDATE: Robert Coup on Web 2.0 <a href=" http://groups.google.com/group/nz-20/browse_frm/thread/a0ca61e3e27dbb27">showed up my google foo</a>; The <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10484922">NZ Herald published this news</a> just over a week ago.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold; font-size:120%;">UPDATE: I <a href="http://drupal.geek.nz/node/86">met the driver</a> and got detail shots today</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold; font-size:120%;">UPDATE: The car was spotted in Christhcurch again on 30th of October.  Odd.</p>

<p>Today I was crossing <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=1 Mansfield ave, Christchurch">Mansfield ave</a> in Merivale, Christchurch when Celeste pointed out a 'Google car'.  I looked and saw a small black car pulling off the curb with a Google logo on the side.  I blinked and noticed a bunch of weird contraptions on it's roof.  I looked a bit harder and saw a smallish orange-brown cylinder with many smaller circles on it.  As the car started driving off I realized it was taking 360ยบ photos for <a href="http://books.google.com/help/maps/streetview/">Google Map's Street View</a>.</p>

<p>We raced to the car to catch it up and follow it but lost it at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=83 Mansfield ave, Christchurch">first intersection</a> (we had to get out of a tight car park).  We drove around the immediate blocks for ten minutes searching for it and gave up.</p>
<p>Then we saw it coming down Devonport lane towards us on <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34 St Albans st, Christchurch">St Albans st</a>.  I quickly pulled a right hand turn into Devonport followed immediately by a U-turn behind the Google car and yet another right hand turn back onto St Albans street.  We followed the car for another ten minutes around what I think, if I recall correctly, was this route;</p>

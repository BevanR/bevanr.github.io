    <p><a href="http://drupal.org/project/c2c">Config to Code</a> module for Drupal 5 makes it easy to deploy new views and panels and to version-control changes to existing ones with a source code repository like subversion.  It makes it quick and easy to move configured views and panels in the database to code, then safely delete the configured views from the database and finally, expose the views and panels in code back to their respective modules.  It is extensible for other types of configurations that can be stored both in database and code.</p>
<p>Config to Code module solves some of the deployment issues that <a href="http://drupal.org/project/features">Features module</a> also solves.  Though Features solves an awful lot more problems than Config to Code does, and is more comprehensive.  Since Features is only for Drupal 6, Config to Code is still a useful tool for Drupal 5 websites.</p>
<p>Here is a short screencast demonstrating <a href="http://drupal.org/project/c2c">Config to Code module</a>.</p>

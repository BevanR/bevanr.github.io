    <p>Unexpectedly, it appears I will probably be able to attend DrupalCon DC 2009.  So I have been working frantically to get my session proposals in.  Here they are;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/advanced-theming-techniques">Advanced Theming Techniques</a>; Getting beginner themers up the Drupal theming learning curve.</li>
<li><a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/paper-prototyping-fix-usability-bugs">Paper Prototyping To Fix Usability Bugs</a>; Designing and contributing drupal core usability bug fixes.</li>
<li><a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/google-maps-mashups-10-minutes">Google Maps Mashups In &lt;10 minutes</a>; Using Drupal's GMap module to create Google Maps mashups on the fly, and showcase of <a href="http://hub.witness.org/map#full-screen">the Hub Map</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you review <a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/sessions?page=5">other <strong>recent</strong> session proposals</a> which don't get a lot of eyes or votes since they are on the last page.<br>

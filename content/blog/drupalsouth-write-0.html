    <p><a href="http://drupalsouth.net.nz/">DrupalSouth</a> was a great success.  As New Zealand's first nation-wide Drupal event, many weren't sure what to expect.  However it seems that most expectations were exceeded; presentations were useful and interesting, ad-hoc unconference time was valuable, food was on time and tasty, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/14718242@N04/2993239711/">beer was drunk</a> and appreciated and most importantly, a good time was had by all!</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=drupalsouth&amp;z=t">some great photos on flickr</a>, a long list of <a href="http://drupalsouth.net.nz/who-is-tweeting-about-drupalsouth">tweets on Twitter</a>, and some write-ups by <a href="http://drupalsouth.net.nz/forum/feedback-from-the-weekend">Michael Dance</a> and <a href="http://www.coffee.geek.nz/drupalsouthmorningchristchurch">Brenda "Shiny" Wallace</a>.  These are all syndicated onto the <a href="http://drupalsouth.net.nz/">DrupalSouth homepage</a>.<br>

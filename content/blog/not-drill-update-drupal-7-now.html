    <p>Half of a client's Drupal 7 sites were compromised over the weekend.</p>
<p>If you did not update your Drupal 7 website by about Friday, your site was probably hacked too: <a href="https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-005">Update to Drupal 7.32</a> or <a href="https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/SA-CORE-2014-005-D7.patch">apply the patch</a> manually updating is not trivial.</p>
<p>After that, you will need to review your site's administrator users, permissions, logs and content for unexpected users, roles, permissions, content and and scripts.</p>

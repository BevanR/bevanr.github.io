    <p>Conservation Strategy Fund (CSF) recently launched their <a href="http://conservation-strategy.org/">new Drupal website</a> and the <a href="http://conservation-strategy.org/hydrocalculator-analyses">HydroCalculator Tool</a>, both by <a href="http://civicactions.com/">CivicActions</a>.&nbsp; CSF's mission is to teach environmental organizations around the world to use economics and strategic analysis to conserve nature.&nbsp; Their new website empowers them to do this with multi-lingual features, news streams and feeds, listings that can be filtered by continent, region, country or theme, tight integration with Salesforce.com for donations and newsletter subscribers and a range of detail about the <a href="http://conservation-strategy.org/en/training">training courses</a> on offer, projects, and publications.</p>

<p>The HydroCalculator Tool was initially developed independently from the website then integrated before launch.&nbsp; It empowers regular citizens, economists and environmentalists alike to analyse and compare Hydro-Electric power station projects.&nbsp; It helps users of the tool to calculate the impact of the dam and reservoir on the environment (including COâ‚‚ emissions), social impact to the people living in the region, and the financial impact (as total cost, and Net Present Value).</p>

    <p>UPDATE: DrupalCon Boston 2008 has now been <a href="http://drupal.org/node/205685">officially announced</a>.</p>
<p>Judging by <a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/">boston2008.drupalcon.org</a> it seems that the planning of DrupalCon Boston March 2008 is well underway.  I've even seen emails with dates about session-planning, yet I can't find any news or announcements about it anywhere.  What's going on?  Is Boston 2008 confirmed?  How come there have been no announcements?</p>
<p>I have been wondering for a while now when there would be some news about the next DrupalCon.  I was rather disappointed about not having been able to make DrupalCon Barcelona 2007.  And I decided way back in September when the last DrupalCon was on that I would definitely not miss the next one.  Since then I have been listening out for rumors and noises about it, but there has been nothing concrete.  Can I get excited about Boston 2008 or do I risk disappointment?</p>

    <p><strong>UPDATE: Buddhika Amila Sampath created the Light Fantastic theme, not Joshua Brauer.  Joshua is the maintainer.</strong><br>
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/lightfantastic"></a> I recently searched on <a href="http://themebot.com/">Themebot</a> for a great contributed Drupal flexible-width theme for <a href="http://drupalsouth.net.nz/">DrupalSouth.net.nz</a> and found <a href="http://drupal.org/project/lightfantastic">Light Fantastic</a>.  <a href="http://brauerranch.com/">Joshua Brauer</a> maintains the awesome Light Fantastic theme, which was created by Buddhika Amila Sampath as part of the Google Summer of Code 2007.<br>

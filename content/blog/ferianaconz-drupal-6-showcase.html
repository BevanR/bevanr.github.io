    <p>I recently finished <a href="http://feriana.co.nz/">Feriana.co.nz</a>, a simple Drupal 6 site for my fiancée and her handbag business.  It uses <a href="http://drupal.org/project/cck">CCK</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Views</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/panels">Panels 2 alpha</a>, as well as <a href="http://drupal.org/project/ImageField">ImageField</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/ImageCache">ImageCache</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/lightbox2">Lightbox2</a> modules.  I also wrote Image Themer and Views Themer modules, which I contributed to the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/themer">Themer package</a> and plan to abstract in to re-usable solutions in my next Drupal 6 theming project which I start this week.  I will also be demonstrating these modules at the <a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/advanced-theming-techniques">Advanced Theming Techniques</a> session (if it gets in – <a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/advanced-theming-techniques">Go Vote</a>!).  You browse the still-very-alpha code for these modules in <a href="http://cvs.drupal.org/viewvc.py/drupal/contributions/modules/themer/">Drupal's CVS repository</a>.</p>

<p>The site is a good example of what can be achieved with a small budget and flexible requirements.  I spent no more than 30 hours total on this website including some contrib-module development, photoshop slicing and resizing and a little custom theming.  The base-theme is <a href="http://drupal.org/project/foliage">foliage</a>.  Before commencing I spent a few hours in conversation with my fiancée (the 'client') working out what was most important sketching some paper prototypes.</p>

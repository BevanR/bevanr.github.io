    <p>I got Navigator 9's official EOL notice last week.  But FF3 still isn't quite ready for me.  Navigator 9 Migrator tool / extension is absolutely useless.</p>
<p>UPDATE: I'm now on FF3 full time and loving it.  I'm still missing a couple of features though:</p>
<p>I still need some extensions to migrate fully:<br>
 * Undo Closed Tabs<br>
 * <del>Firebug</del></p>
<p>and really really want (almost need):<br>
 * Mac Favicon XL (theme)<br>
 * Google PageRank Status, or SearchStatus (enables Google web history)<br>
 * <del>It's All Text!</del></p>
<p>And would like<br>
 * Html Validator<br>
 * ColorZilla<br>
 * dragdropupload<br>
 * Email This!<br>
 * ShowIP<br>
 * Gmail manager (Gmail Notifier is okay for the interim)<br>
 * <del>ErrorZilla</del></p>

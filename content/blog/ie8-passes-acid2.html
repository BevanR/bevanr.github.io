<p>Dean at M$ reckons IE8 passes the ACID2 face 'test'.  I'm dubious.  The screen shot is convincing, but I'll believe when I've seen it with my own eyes.</p>
<p>He also <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2007/12/19/internet-explorer-8-and-acid2-a-milestone.aspx">rants</a> a bit, trying to pass off web standards as not-so important.  His article was also <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/12/19/2231235">slashdotted</a>.</p>

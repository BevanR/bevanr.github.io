    <p>Mozilla has finally announced Firefox 3's launch date; this Tuesday 17 June.  (Note that's probably US time, so it will be Wednesday in NZ).</p>
<p>Mozilla wants to break a guiness world record for number of downloads in one day and I'm sure they'll achieve it. You can go pledge on spreadfirefox.com (A drupal site): <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/en-US/worldrecord" title="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/en-US/worldrecord">http://www.spreadfirefox.com/en-US/worldrecord</a></p>
<p>I created a "FF3 launch party" event in Christchurch for kicks on mozillaparty.com: <a href="http://mozillaparty.com/en-US/events/view/101" title="http://mozillaparty.com/en-US/events/view/101">http://mozillaparty.com/en-US/events/view/101</a></p>
<p>I think we get some free gear if enough people come or something.</p>

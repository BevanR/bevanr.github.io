    <p>I don't like to advertise, but this might save someone $1000 USD:</p>
<p>If you've been thinking about coming to New Zealand from the US, now is the time to get tickets.  Qantas has specials that have <a href="http://www.qantas.com.au/regions/dyn/us/specials/webDeals287">cut flight prices by about 50%</a>.</p>
<p>$900-$1000 USD from West Coast USA to <acronym title="Auckland">AKL</acronym>, <acronym title="Wellington">WTN</acronym>, <acronym title="Christchurch">CHC</acronym> or Queenstown.<br>
Around $1300 USD from East Coast to <acronym title="Auckland">AKL</acronym>, <acronym title="Wellington">WTN</acronym>, <acronym title="Christchurch">CHC</acronym> or Queenstown.</p>
<p>If you're thinking about going to <a href="http://drupalapc.org/">Drupalcon Sydney</a> in May, it may be cheaper to fly via NZ with those specials.  Flights from NZ to Sydney start at around $350 USD.  It certainly wouldn't be much more expensive.</p>
<p>Unfortunately they don't have equivalent specials from NZ to the US.</p>
<p>[update] this was mis-titled "Cheap Flights to DrupalAPC via Sydney".  Corrected to "Cheap Flights to DrupalAPC via NZ".  Thanks lyricnz for the notice</p>

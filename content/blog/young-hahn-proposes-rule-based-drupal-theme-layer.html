    <p>While there were many great presentations at <a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/" rel="nofollow">DrupalCon DC</a>, <a href="http://www.developmentseed.org/team/young-hahn" rel="nofollow">Young Hahn</a>'s <em><a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/limitations-drupal-theme-layer" rel="nofollow">Limitations of the Drupal Theme Layer</a></em> was the only one that blew me away.  Most of the session attendees and readers of the <a href="http://www.developmentseed.org/blog/2009/mar/01/limitations-drupal-theme-layer" rel="nofollow">related blog post</a> seem to miss his main point;  a proposal for a <strong>rule-based theme layer</strong>.</p>

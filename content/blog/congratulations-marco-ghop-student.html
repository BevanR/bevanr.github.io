    <p>I just completed a pass on all of the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues?states=1,16,8,13,14,15,2,3,4,5,6,7&amp;submitted=marco.robotangel">usability issues created</a> by <a href="http://drupal.org/user/212039">Marco.RobotAngel</a> for <a href="http://drupal.org/node/197248">GHOP task #48</a> and I wanted to say well done Marco!  :)</p>
<p>The task was to take all of the excellent feedback and suggested solutions in <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/7043">Factory Joe's review</a> and task-ify them or create patches if the solution was simple.  This sounds like an easy task, but is in fact very difficult considering the amount of excellent usability feedback <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/">Factory Joe</a> gave us.  Marco also learned how to create review and apply patches and started integrating himself with the drupal community.</p>
<p>I found a lot of great <a href="http://drupal.geek.nz/node/82">Newbie tasks</a> while doing this review.</p>

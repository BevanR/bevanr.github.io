    <p>I recently needed to purchase two replacement batteries for Apple laptops.  One for a MacBook 13-inch white, and one for a MacBook Pro 17-inch.  I decided to purchase third-party batteries since the saving was about 30% and they came with a 12-month warranty.  While I had the original and third-party replacement batteries in one place, I decided to snap some photos so that others can see the differences between Apple's replacement batteries and third-party ones.</p>

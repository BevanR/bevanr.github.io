    <p><a href="http://palantir.net/"><img align="right" alt="Logo of Palantir.net" src="http://palantir.net/files/sitetheme_logo.png"></a>Today is a new beginning.  Today is my first day at <a href="http://palantir.net/about/team/rudge">Palantir.net</a>.  I am now a "<em>Palantiri</em>"!  (That's Palantiri-speak for someone who works at Palantir.net. ;)</p>
<p>Palantir.net is a high-end Drupal consulting &amp; services company based in Chicago, Illinois, USA.  Palantir.net has <a href="http://palantir.net/about/team">a great team of Drupal developers and contributors</a>, including some friends and past colleagues from <a href="http://civicactions.com/">CivicActions</a> and <a href="http://nowpublic.com/">NowPublic</a>.  And I am excited to be a part of that team!</p>

  <em>"Bevan joins our Front-end Development (FED) team as a senior front-end developer. A permanent member of the Drupal Association, Bevan is an active community member and a jack-of-all-Drupal-trades with expertise in theming, Javascript, and module development.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>This means that I will be traveling back to North America again in June already, for a one-week long Palantir on-site, <a href="http://www.chicagodrupalcamp.org/">DrupalCamp Chicago</a> and one-week working in-house in Palantir's offices.</p>
<p>My title at Palantir.net is "<em>Senior Front End Developer</em>" (aka "<em>themer</em>", or "<em><acronym title="Front End Developer">FED</acronym></em>").</p>
<p>To new beginnings...</p>

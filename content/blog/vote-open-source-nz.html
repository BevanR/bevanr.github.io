    <p>Are you heading out to vote this morning?  Have you thought about how each of the parties support open source?  The <a href="http://www.greens.org.nz/node/19596">Greens's IT policy</a> explicitly states a number of policies about encouraging Open Source in Business, Government and Education.</p>
<p>It's hard to beat that!  Further;  The Greens use <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> and <a href="http://civicrm.org/">CiviCRM</a> heavily in both their public-facing and internal systems -- their actions match their words.  Go Greens!</p>

    <p><a title="New Zealand's new Copyright Law presumes 'Guilt Upon Accusation' and will Cut Off Internet Connections without a trial. Join the black out protest against it!" href="http://creativefreedom.org.nz/blackout.html" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://creativefreedom.org.nz/library/black-out/banner-300x250.gif" alt="New Zealand's new Copyright Law presumes 'Guilt Upon Accusation' and will Cut Off Internet Connections without a trial. Join the black out protest against it!" align="right"></a>Over the last week Twitter and Facebook users across New Zealand and the world, have been blacking out their avatars in protest of S92A, a change in New Zealand's copyright law that will require <acronym title="Internet Service Providers" rel="nofollow">ISP</acronym>s to disconnect any user accused of copyright infringement.  No proof or evidence is required, just accusation.  This is a terrible law for many reasons, which are <a href="http://creativefreedom.org.nz/" rel="nofollow">well documented on CreativeFreedom.org.nz</a>, and elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: Internet Blackout NZ is thus far successful.  We successfully delayed changes to Section 92A for 4 weeks!  It is expected that this will give the new New Zealand government time to fully understand the ridiculousness of the law change, and dismiss it entirely.  See <a href="http://civicactions.com/blog/2009/feb/22/online_protest_successful_internet_blackout_nz" rel="nofollow">my latest blog post</a> for more details.</strong></p>

It inspired others to follow-up with a website blackout event today, Monday 23 February.  I already partially blacked out <a href="http://drupal.geek.nz" rel="nofollow">my blog</a> last week, however this blackout will be more thorough than my website-decolouration or 'grey-out'.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: This is what drupal.geek.nz looked like during the week of February 16-23:</strong></p>

<p>I have created a Drupal module to help any Drupal websites owners quickly blackout their website, if they want to participate.  Currently it's only a Drupal 6 module, however if anyone really wants it for their Drupal 5 website and doesn't have the technical skills to backport it, I may help out with this.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/internetblackoutnz" rel="nofollow">Internet Blackout NZ module</a> blacks out a Drupal website with a link to <a href="http://creativefreedom.org.nz/forum/topic.php?post=473#post473" rel="nofollow">Creative Freedom's post</a> about the issue and event.  Some pages are not blacked out, so that the module can be disabled; user, user/*, admin and admin/*.  The list of pages NOT blacked out is configurable, as is the blackout page title, link, content and CSS.  See the <a href="" rel="nofollow">module's README.txt</a> or <a href="http://drupal.org/project/internetblackoutnz" rel="nofollow">the project page</a> for instructions.</p>

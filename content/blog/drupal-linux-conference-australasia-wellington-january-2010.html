    <img align="right" alt="Penguins Crossing; LCA Wellington 2010 logo" src="http://www.lca2010.org.nz/images/logo.jpg"><a href="http://www.lca2010.org.nz/about/linux.conf.au">Linux Conference Australasia (aka LCA, linux.conf.au) will be in Wellington 18-23 January 2010</a> – 6 and a half months from now.  This presents opportunities for the NZ Drupal community to;

<ol>
  <li>Promote Drupal in the wider FLOSS community (which is good for business)</li>
  <li>Run a DrupalCamp/Conference; which allows attendees to combine expenses if attending LCA, and organizers to share venue, admin, financial and other resources with LCA.</li>
  <li>Just hang out and drink &amp; talk Drupal! Or perhaps (talk) and (drink drupal)!? :)</li>
</ol>

  <li>
    <h3>Promote Drupal</h3>
    <p>With the <a href="http://civicactions.com/blog/2009/jun/08/new_zealand_government_rejects_microsoft">government moving away from Microsoft</a> products and towards Open Source, and (hopefully) a <a href="http://civicactions.com/blog/2009/jun/22/urgent_unlimited_software_patents_new_zealand_act_now">FLOSS-friendly Patents Act</a> in NZ, it is a very critical time to be making folk aware of Drupal and how it can empower them and their organisation/s.</p>
    <p>This is good for the Drupal marketplace, and good for anyone providing Drupal services in NZ – probably you!?  (Conferences like this are also great places to grow your own business network directly!)</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.lca2010.org.nz/programme/open_day">Saturday 23 January is <em>Open Day</em> at LCA</a> and is probably a good opportunity to set up a Drupal stand or similar.  We would be able to use the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bevanr/2999115386/">Drupal banner from DrupalSouth</a> for this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Run a DrupalCamp/Conference</h3>
    <p><a href="http://www.lca2010.org.nz/media/news/47">LCA is taking proposals for miniconfs</a> during, before or after LCA.  Given the prominence of Drupal in both the web and FLOSS communities it's likely a well–organised and well-written proposal would be accepted.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, we could organize our own DrupalCamp or mini-conference outside of LCA proper. Though LCA-miniconfs make admin easier and minimize the overhead of organizing a DrupalCamp or miniconf.</p>
    <p>Perhaps such an event could be <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/21721">DrupalSouth 2</a>?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Hang out and talk Drupal!</h3>
    <p>With or without the above (or other Drupal events), it'd be great to meetup with other Drupalers and talk Drupal in the bars.  Who else is planning on or thinking about attending?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

I'm very keen to be involved in any/all of the above, but won't have enough bandwidth to be a driving force behind organizing anything big while living in Thailand (from September).  I'm loosely planning on being back and living in NZ (maybe Wellington) in time for LCA.

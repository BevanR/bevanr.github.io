    <p>Wow.  <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> still blows me away with its features and bundles.  It's the best value software I ever bought.  I just discovered some more great features with SVN and CSS bundles on this pretty site:</p>

</ul>
<p>I've also been using <a href="http://www.activestate.com/products/komodo_ide/">Komodo IDE</a> for debugging for the last week.  It's great.  A BIG time-saver when you're sure your code is right, but it's still not behaving as you expected.  It's pricey, but worth it if you spend more than a few hours a week going through your code line by line to find what went wrong.  I'm eligible for education pricing, so I got it for $50 USD.</p>

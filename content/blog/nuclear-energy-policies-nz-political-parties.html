    <p>Most <abbr title="New Zealanders">kiwis</abbr> are, unfortunately, too proud of New Zealand's traditional anti-nuclear political stance to keep an open mind on the topic.  Media and politics promote the idea that the rest of the world is "<em>impressed</em>" by our political stance.  (My impression is that the rest of the world actually thinks our policy is stupid.)</p>
<p>Kiwis are <em>so</em> proud of our nuclear stance, that it would probably be political suicide for a politician or political party to say "lets build nuclear power stations" or even just "lets revisit bans on nuclear ships".</p>
<p>None of the three highest polling parties have published a policy on nuclear energy.  None of their energy policies even mention "nuclear".</p>
<p>(All policies focus on renewable energy.  National and Labour both have policies for 90% renewable energy by 2025.  Greens' policy is 100% by 2030.)</p>
<p>Whether the lack of "nuclear" is because they are afraid of loss of support if they announced anything concieved as pro-nuclear, because they truly believe a ban on nuclear energy is best, or they simply failed to form or document a policy on it, is up for conjecture.</p>
<p>But the fact that nuclear is not even <em>mentioned</em> in any of those policy documents suggests to me that it is probably the fear of backlash.  Although I have heard from multiple sources that New Zealand's energy consumption is too low to justify the cost of nuclear energy.</p>

<p>Of course, <a href="http://drupal.geek.nz/blog/how-be-climate-voter-nz-general-elections">nuclear policies are of minor significance in the face of climate change</a> as a whole.</p>

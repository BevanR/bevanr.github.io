    <p><a href="http://factoryjoe.pbwiki.com/FeedbackForDrupal6">Chris Messina's (aka Factory Joe) review</a> of drupal 6 is a big contribution to drupal usability.  I have highlighted about <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/7043">50 actionable issues that have been raised and/or discussed</a> through this review.  Most of them are trivial changes for drupal 6, but are key usability improvements.  Many are simply improving the help text.  Some are larger tasks that require more work and changes and should probably wait for drupal 7.  (They can still have d.o issue nodes created so they aren't lost and forgotten.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately I can't afford any more time on this myself this month (I have to make some money too, to be able to afford to contribute!).  I hope others can choose a few @TODO's on <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/7043">the review discussion page</a> and;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal">search</a> for existing issue nodes or <a href="http://drupal.org/patch">patches</a> addressing the issue</li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/node/add/project-issue/drupal">create a new issue</a> if none is found</li>
<li>so that your effort is not duplicated by others, mark the @TODOs as done, and link to the d.o issue from <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/7043/edit">the review</a>
<ul>
<li>to mark as done, change <code>**@TODO: foo bar**</code> to <code>*@DONE: foo bar* (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/123456" title="http://drupal.org/node/123456">http://drupal.org/node/123456</a>)</code>.  This removes the bold, and makes it easier to find what @TODOs are remaining with ctrl+F.</li>
<li>be sure to make your changes quickly as others may edit and submit before you do</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>fix the issue and <a href="http://drupal.org/patch/submit">submit a patch</a>, or <a href="http://drupal.org/patch/review">review any existing patch(es)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues?projects=3060&amp;states=8&amp;versions=97368,184399,175832,194287">review patches</a> for other usability issues!</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll do my best to review all submitted usability patches!</p>

    <p><a href="http://sf2010.drupal.org/conference/sessions/jquery-designers-and-themers">jQuery for Designers and Themers</a> is a fun interactive session at <a href="http://sf2010.drupal.org/">DrupalCon San francisco</a> on getting started with <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>.  It is targeted at designers and themers but is suitable for anyone with a decent understanding of HTML and CSS â€” no programming experience is necessary.  It doesn't include any PHP, and only basic programming concepts are introduced.</p>
<p>The session is <a href="http://sf2010.drupal.org/conference/schedule">early on Tuesday 20 April in room 307 (Commerce guys) at DrupalCon SF at 8:30am</a>.</p>
<p>The sample code is available at <a href="http://drupal.org/project/jq4dat">Drupal.org/Project/jQ4DaT</a> and slides are available at <a href="http://docs.google.com/present/view?id=drmcbw4_1816qv2fkc7">TinyURL.com/jQuery-Designers (Google Docs)</a>.</p>

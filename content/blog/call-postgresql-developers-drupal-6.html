    <p>For those that don't read the <a href="http://lists.drupal.org/listinfo/development">development list</a>; there has been considerable discussion recently (following <a href="http://2bits.com/articles/benchmarking-postgresql-vs-mysql-performance-using-drupal-5x.html">Khaled's PG vs MySQL benchmarks</a>) about <a href="http://lists.drupal.org/archives/development/2007-11/msg00213.html">improving PG support in drupal 6</a>.</p>
<p>I haven't followed the whole discussion in detail (so please correct my if I'm wrong or have missed something), but it seems that for PG support to be sustained and/or improve in drupal6, more PG testers and developers with an interest in PG support are needed.</p>

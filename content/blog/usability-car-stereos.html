    <p>For a long time I have wondered how the teams that design car stereos can fail so miserably at making car stereos easy to use.  The function of a car stereo is not complicated, and there are few tasks that need to be considered in the design of a car stereo interface.  Approximately in order of importance these tasks are;</p>
<ol>
<li>lower the volume</li>
<li>kill the sound</li>
<li>raise the volume</li>
<li>select the source (e.g. FM, AM, CD, Auxiliary)</li>
<li>skip tracks</li>
<li>change the frequency</li>
</ol>

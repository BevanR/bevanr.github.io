It is targeted at designers and themers but is suitable for anyone with a decent understanding of HTML and CSS â€” no programming experience is necessary.  It doesn't include any PHP, and only basic programming concepts are introduced.</p>

<p>I've presented sessions like this one twice before.  The first time at <a href="http://paris2009.drupalcon.org/session/jquery-designers-and-themers">DrupalCon Paris September 2009</a>, and the second time at <a href="http://wellington2010.drupalsouth.net.nz/session/jquery-basics-plus-plus">DrupalSouth Wellington January 2010</a>, where it was successful and well received and both times.</p>

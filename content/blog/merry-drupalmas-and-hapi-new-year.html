    <p>Christmas wasn't very merry for me;  I spent all day in bed and in the bathroom with a wicked tommy-ache and couldn't eat anything.  Now it looks like I won't be able to speak at my friends New Year's Eve doo unless my throat improves vastly in the next few hours (At least I can still attend for the mushy food and the atmosphere!).  So my NYE probably won't be too happy (though not sad) either.</p>
<p>But for all my virtual friends and colleagues; I sincerely wish you all a great NYE experience, and hope you had a great christmas that was at least twice as much fun as mine!  All the best for 2008 and beyond.  I think 2008 will be the year that drupal achieves it's ultimate goal of world-domination (at least in web-platform systems anyway!).</p>

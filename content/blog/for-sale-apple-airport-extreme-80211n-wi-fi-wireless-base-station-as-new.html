    <p>I'm selling my <a href="http://www.trademe.co.nz/Computers/Networking-modems/Wireless-networking/Routers/auction-134794372.htm">Apple AirPort Base station</a>.  This device kicks-arse, but it's now surplus; <a href="http://www.trademe.co.nz/Computers/Networking-modems/Wireless-networking/Routers/auction-134794372.htm" title="http://www.trademe.co.nz/Computers/Networking-modems/Wireless-networking/Routers/auction-134794372.htm">http://www.trademe.co.nz/Computers/Networking-modems/Wireless-networking...</a></p>
<p>If you want it for $190 (mates-rates), let me know asap so I can cancel the auction before anyone bids.</p>

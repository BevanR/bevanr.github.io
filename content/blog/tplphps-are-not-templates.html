    <p>Drupal's template files (<code>*.tpl.php</code>) are not really templates.  This is what my DrupalCon <a href="http://sf2010.drupal.org/conference/core-developer-summit">core developer summit</a> submission is about.  The slides briefly explain why tpl.phps are not real templates, what real templates are, why this is a problem for the Drupal project and community, and mentions some possible solutions to the problem.  It also provides some basic guidelines as a starting point for tpl.php standards, should that be pursued.</p>

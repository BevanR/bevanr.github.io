    <p>I estimate hundreds of thousands of Drupal websites now have backdoors; between ten and ninety percent of all Drupal websites.  Automated Drupageddon exploits were in the wild within hours of the announcement.  <strong>Updating or patching Drupal does not fix backdoors</strong> that attackers installed before updating or patching Drupal.  Backdoors give attackers admin access and allow arbitrary PHP execution.</p>

<p>If your Drupal 7 (and 8) website is not updated or patched it is most likely compromised.  If your website was not updated within a day of the announcement, it is probably compromised.  Even if your website was updated within a day, it may be compromised.</p>

<p>If you did not know, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/drupageddon">Drupageddon</a> is the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-005">highly critical SQL injection vulnerability in Drupal core announced 15 October</a>.  It is also known as <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/drupalgeddon">Drupalgeddon</a> (with an "L"), CVE-2014-3704, Drupal SA core 2014 005 and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/drupalsa05">#DrupalSA05</a>.  Drupageddon (no "L") is the original name selected by Stefan Horst, who initially reported to the Drupal security team.  See <a href="http://drupageddon.com">Drupageddon.com</a>.</p>

<p>I have drafted this flowchart to help Drupal website administrators understand their options for recovering from Drupageddon.  Review, feedback and collaboration is welcome.</p>

<p>The flowchart is a living document.  Currently version is number 7.</p>

<h3>Updates</h3>

  <li>The Drupal security team has published <a href="https://www.drupal.org/PSA-2014-003">PSA-2014-003, a public service announcement about recovering websites compromised by Drupageddon exploits</a>. The official recommendation is: <strong>Restore from pre-October-15-backups</strong>.  This is good advice.  (I co-authored the PSA.)</li>

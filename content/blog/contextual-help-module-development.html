    <p>One of the findings of the Drupal <a href="http://drupal.org/node/204667">usability testing at UMN</a> in February was that users like, use and like to use contextual help.  Many of the participants explicitly said that they would have liked more of it during their evaluations and in debriefing.<br>
As a developer it is difficult to anticipate where contextual help is appropriate, needed or perhaps why it's even necessary.  While usability testing is possibly the only way to effectively determine <em>exactly</em> where contextual help is needed and useful and where it's not, I think this example might help developers understand when where and why contextual help is likely to be helpful.  This is part of developing sympathy for the user.<br>

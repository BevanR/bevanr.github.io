    <p>Gmail offline is finally here!  As per my <a href="http://twitter.com/BevanR/status/1163633089" rel="nofollow">message on twitter</a>; <em>It's <strong>fast</strong> â€“ even better than Gmail <strong>online</strong>. Faster than desktop apps. The internet revolution is here!</em><br>
You'll need to enable Gmail "Experimental features" first. I've forgotten how to do this, but I think it's in the admin "cpanel" for Google Apps for Your Domain.  I'm not sure about Google-proper Gmail.<br>
Once you have that;</p>
<ol>
<li>go to <em>Settings</em> (in Gmail)</li>
<li>then <em>Labs</em></li>
</ol>

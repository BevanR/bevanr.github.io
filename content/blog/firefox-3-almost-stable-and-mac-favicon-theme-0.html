    <p>I just got this email from Mozilla about the soon release of Firefox 3 release candidate, asking addon developers to get their extensions updated and released for FF3 RCs.  If you have an extension released on <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org">addons.mozilla.org</a> you would have received this email too.  I have two variations of FF2's default Mac theme that enable favicons in the bookmarks toolbar: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3692">Mac Favicon</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3691">Mac Favicon XL</a>.<br>

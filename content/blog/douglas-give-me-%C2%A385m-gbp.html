    <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Can anyone tell me why this page gets so many hits?</p>
<p>Good ol' '<a href="mailto:douglas_smith100@excite.com">Douglas Smith</a>' of <a href="http://www.prime-bank.com/">Prime Bank</a> (at least the bank is real) wants to give me half of the £8.5 million pound sterling he's trying to steal from the bank:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am an auditor for PRIME BANK London, during my last auditing I realized an unclaimed Bank Draft of 8,528,000GBP</p>
<p>(Eight Million Five Hundred and Twenty Eight Thousand GBP).I need an honest person that I can present as the beneficiary to this funds, which would be transferred to you for the benefit of the two of us.The funds shall be shared 50/50 between the two of us at the completion of this transaction.Let me know at <a href="mailto:douglas_smith100@excite.com">douglas_smith100@excite.com</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder how many people still actually fall for this crap?</p>

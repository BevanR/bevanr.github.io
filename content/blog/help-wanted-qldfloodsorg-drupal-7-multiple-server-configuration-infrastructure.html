An area twice the size of Texas is underwater.  Entire homes are completely inundated.  <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/video/flash-flood-in-toowoomba-caught-on-tape/article1865597/?from=1866476">Bridges</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYUpkPTcqPY">cars have been washed away like toys</a>.  In Brisbane, <a href="http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/asiapacific/features/article_1609286.php/Australia-Flood-Pictures-January-4th?page=11">airports are closed</a> and the CBD has been closed down.  There are at least <a href="http://tvnz.co.nz/world-news/15-confirmed-dead-queensland-flood-toll-rises-3997061">15 dead and more than 60 still missing</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://qldfloods.org">QLDfloods.org</a> is a Drupal 7 website set up by several members of the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/australia">Australian Drupal community</a> to provide information, track missing persons, find resources and people that need them (like beds), track damage and provide support.  It was mentioned four times on CNN on Wednesday and multiple times on Australian national media.</p>

    <p>The late breaking news ripping through the twitter-sphere and hitting the blogosphere is that<br>
</p><blockquote>Matt Mullenweg, founder of <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> and creator of open-source blogging system WordPress... <a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/01/22/wordpresscom-creator-raises-29m/">raised a whopping $29.5 million</a> in a Series B Round of funding, including a strategic investment from The New York Times Co. True Ventures led the round, which includes previous investors Polaris Ventures and Radar Ventures. (Full disclosure: both Automattic and GigaOM are backed by True Ventures.)</blockquote><p></p>
<p><a href="http://ma.tt/2008/01/act-two/">Matt confirmed this</a> in his blog.</p>
<p>This comes at an interesting time in relation to <a href="http://acquia.com/">Acquia</a>'s news of "<a href="http://acquia.com/press-release-1">$7 million in a Series A financing</a>".</p>
<p>Although this doesn't affect <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>, Dries or Acquia directly in any way that I can think of it's interesting to compare;</p>
<ul>
<li>Acquia raised 'Series A' financing while Automattic raised 'Series B' financing.  I have NFI what the difference is and was hoping someone could tell me.</li>
<li>Automattic raised almost 30M -- more than 4 times what Acquia raised 7M.</li>
<li>Automattic is more than two years old, while Acquia is barely two months old.</li>
<li>While Acquia isn't offering any commercial or consumer service or product yet, Automattic is already providing a wide range of free and commercial consumer-oriented <a href="http://automattic.com/projects/">products</a> and <a href="http://automattic.com/services/">services</a>.  They seem to be targeting the casual blogger; a niche ranging from the blogspot.com blogger to startups, hobbiests, non-profits and low-budget bloggers.  </li>
</ul>

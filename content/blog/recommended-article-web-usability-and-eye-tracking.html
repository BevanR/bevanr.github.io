    <p>This great <a href="http://www.virtualhosting.com/blog/2007/scientific-web-design-23-actionable-lessons-from-eye-tracking-studies/">article on web readability and usability</a> based on results of eye-tracking analysis was fairly unsurprising for me, except for this snippet;</p>
<blockquote><p>Clean, clear faces in images attract more eye fixation. While they might look good with your design, abstract and artsy photos aren’t going to garner much reader attention. If you’re using photos with people in them, make sure they are clear, easy to read shots. It should also be noted that photos with “real” people, not models, perform better.</p></blockquote>

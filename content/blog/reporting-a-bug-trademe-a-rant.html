    <p>So I found an obscure bug on TradeMe, but there is no way to report it.  The <a href="http://www.trademe.co.nz/Help/ContactUs.aspx">contact us</a> section just led to an <a href="http://www.trademe.co.nz/Help/SpamFilters.aspx">unhelpful help page</a>.  The only email address I could find was <a href="mailto:mediaenquiries@trademe.co.nz">mediaenquiries@trademe.co.nz</a> on the <a href="mediaenquiries@trademe.co.nz">Corporate enquiries</a> page.  So in order to report the bug I have to blog about it, so I can pass it off as media.  </p>
<p>Frick!  How hard would it be to have a contact form that is read and where useful messages are directed accordingly and other messages are ignored.  Then there's the fact that although TradeMe has market domination and is likely firkin raking it in, they "can't afford staff to read your email nor reply to it".  I wish <a href="http://www.sellmefree.co.nz/">SellMeFree</a> had a chance.</p>
<p>Anyway.  Here's the bug: Deleted favourite searches can not be re-added.  To reproduce;</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to a terminal category</li>
<li>Filter by region</li>
<li>Save the category with the "Save as a favourite category button"</li>
<li>Go to "My Favourites"</li>
<li>Remove the favourite category as a favorite</li>
<li>Go back to the category</li>
<li>The category cannot be saved as a favourite category again.  Because the button is disabled and says "Saved as a favourite category" already.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please fix it TradeMe!  I need a new fridge for our new house and your website sucks so I'm gonna be without a fridge and my milk will go off and I'll die of either starvation from skipping breakfast or food poisoning from drinking rotten milk.  Thanks!  :)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I'm checking out SellMeFree again...</p>

    <p>This one is from a <a href="http://hub.witness.org/sites/default/themes/witness/scripts/witness.js">javascript file</a> by an unknown colleague at <a href="http://civicactions.com">CivicActions</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><code> * WARNING * WARNING * WARNING * WARNING<br>
 * there is a rediculous amount of stupidity going on here to deal with<br>
 * safari + ie + ff + tabs + gmaps + form data<br>
 * don't mess with this unless you enjoy a belt sander in the eye.<br>

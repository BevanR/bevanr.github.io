    <p>Google will pay high school kids aged 13 to 18 up to $500 for their participation in <a href="http://code.google.com/opensource/ghop/2007-8/">GHOP</a>. The first round is a bit of a trial and has only ten projects involved, and <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> is one of them!  The others are;</p>
<ul>
<li>Apache Software Foundation</li>
<li>GNOME</li>
<li>Joomla!</li>
<li>MoinMoin</li>
<li>Mono</li>
<li>Moodle</li>
<li>Plone</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>SilverStripe</li>
</ul>
<p>It is both impressive and interesting how many of them are web-content tools (CMS, web-application frameworks, wikis etc).  I also need to congratulate <a href="http://www.silverstripe.com/">SilverStripe</a>, a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=nz">locally</a>-grown-and-nutured CMS.  Kudos to the Wellington whanau.</p>
<p><a href="http://drupal.org/node/195913">As for Drupal</a>, the project has been allowed exactly 102 tasks (Where do they get that number from?).  So far, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-drupal/issues/list">27 out of 47 open tasks</a> have already been claimed, in less than 48 hours.</p>

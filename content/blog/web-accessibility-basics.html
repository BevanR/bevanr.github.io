    <p>CivicActions endeavors that our websites be usable. <em>Usable</em> implies <em>accessible</em>, since a user with special needs can not use an inaccessible site.  In this article I discuss techniques that every web developer, themer and front-end html coder should have in their toolkit.  These are the low-hanging fruit, the simple and inexpensive techniques, that make a big difference for internet users with restricted access, from user with low bandwidth internet connections, to users with poor eyesight.

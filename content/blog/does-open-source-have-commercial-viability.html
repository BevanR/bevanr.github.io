    <p>"<a href="http://stuartbale.blogspot.com/2008/01/does-open-source-have-commercial.html">Does Open Source Have Commercial Viability?</a>" is a response to my <a href="http://drupal.geek.nz/node/50">review of Xero.com</a> by <a href="http://stuartbale.blogspot.com/">Stuart Bale</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/5/028/175">Product Manager</a> at <a href="http://myob.com/">MYOB</a>.  Today he left a comment to <a href="http://drupal.geek.nz/node/50#comment-88">let me know</a> about it.</p>
<p>This isn't my reply -- I don't think I can be bothered.  But I know there are a lot of people that disagree and care enough to reply.</p>

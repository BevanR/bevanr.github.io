    <p><a href="http://season.openusability.org/"><img src="http://season.openusability.org/wp-content/themes/season/images/season_logo.png" alt="Logo of Season of Usability" align="right"></a>I still haven't been able to establish a technical mentor for my SoU project.  I need a Drupal developer with a fair amount of Drupal karma and a small interest in usability, for this project to be successful.  I'll be plain; <strong>I'm directly asking Dries, core developers, and other similarly-respected folk in the Drupal community, for someone who can commit about 3 hours per week for three months</strong>.  This is a sizable contribution to Drupal and will result in considerable usability improvements.</p>
<p>Please see details on <a href="http://www.civicactions.com/blog/drupal_mentor_needed_for_season_of_usability_programme">CivicActions blog</a> for details.  I also posted the original request on <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/7554">g.d.o</a> and the <a href="http://lists.drupal.org/archives/development/2007-12/msg00057.html">developers list</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.civicactions.com/">CivicActions</a> for co-sponsoring this project and to <a href="http://www.openusability.org/">OpenUsability</a> who are making this possible through the <a href="http://season.openusability.org/">Season of Usability</a> initiative.</p>

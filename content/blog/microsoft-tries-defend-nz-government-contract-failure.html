    <p>Kathryn Ryan of Radio NZ <a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/ninetonoon/20090527" rel="nofollow">interviewed Don Christie, president of the NZ Open Source Society and Kevin Ackhurst, managing director of Microsoft NZ on Microsoft's failure to renew their multi-million dollar contract with the NZ government</a>.&nbsp; The interviews and Kathryn's questions are intense and very interesting as Don Christie defends the government's choice to break out of a reliance on Microsoft's products, and Kevin Ackhurst tries to defend Microsoft's position, touting it as a success.<br>
Highlights for me were Kevin Ackhursts rehearsed tape-recorder responses that avoid answering Kathryn's questions, and Kathryn's obvious frustration with his failure to state things as they are.&nbsp; It's clear that Microsoft wants to paint this as a success story, but is failing pretty badly.<br>
I love Don Christie's "Microsoft software is like a virus..." which reminds me of <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/01/06/01/1658258.shtml" rel="nofollow">Microsoft's "linux is a cancer"</a> statements.<br>

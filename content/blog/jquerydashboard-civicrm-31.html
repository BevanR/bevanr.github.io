    <p>In January 2009 I wrote and released <a href="http://drupal.geek.nz/blog/jquerydashboard-plugin">jQuery.dashboard() plugin</a>, which extends jQuery to quickly and easily create dashboard UIs like iGoogle.  A handful of people have using it for a while, but in December 2009, it was <a href="http://civicrm.org/node/677">announced that CiviCRM 3.1 would include a dashboard feature utilising jQuery.dashboard() plugin</a>!  <a href="">CiviCRM 3.1 was released late January 2010</a>.  (So this blog post is a little late!)</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://drupal.demo.civicrm.org/civicrm/dashboard?reset=1">try it out yourself at CiviCRM's Drupal demo site</a>.</p>
<p>It is great to see that people are finding value in code I wrote and it is encouraging that it is so widely used!</p>

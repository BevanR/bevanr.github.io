    <p>The Drupal security team published <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2764899">a PSA to warn about upcoming security advisories</a>.  I shared <a href="https://www.js.geek.nz/blog/drupalgeddon-are-you-ready">my advice and predicted attacks within the hour</a> after the security advisories are published.  The security advisories are now published.  Here is my followup.</p>
<p>I applaud the Drupal Security Team for warning about the highly critical updates.  However the public service announcement (PSA) left the impression that this event was going to be much more serious than it was.  Such a PSA would have been perfectly appropriate for <a href="https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-005">SA-CORE-2014-005 "Drupalgeddon"</a>.  But the only <a href="https://www.drupal.org/PSA-2014-003">PSA there was in hindsight</a>.</p>
<p>I guess it is resonable for the Drupal Security Team to be over cautious, especially given the lessons learned from Drupalgeddon fallout.  And of course, such decisions and criticism is much easier with hindsight.</p>
<p>But now I am concerned how the Drupal Security Team can realistically raise the level further there is another vulnerability that <strong>is</strong> as serious as Drupalgeddon.  Even if they raise the alert level using language in the PSA, will people still believe them?  It reminds me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boy_Who_Cried_Wolf">the boy who cried wolf</a>.</p>
<p>Of course serious vulnerabilities like these are rare events in Drupal, so there is not yet a standard to compare alert levels to.</p>

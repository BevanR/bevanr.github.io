<p>The second <em>Drupal Downunder</em> will be Australasia's biggest Drupal event ever, with <a href="http://drupaldownunder.org/dries-buytaert">Dries Buytaert</a> returning for his second DrupalDownunder, and other keynotes from <a href="http://drupaldownunder.org/dmitri-gaskin">Dimitri Gaskin</a> and <a href="http://drupaldownunder.org/gian-wild">Gian Wild</a>.</p>
<p>And tonnes of other great content, tutorials and sessions by other Drupalistas from Australia, New Zealand and beyond.</p>
<p>If you have been thinking about submitting a session proposal about that really interesting project, client or code you worked on recently, or have some special skill set you want to share with the Drupal community, get your ideas into words this weekend and submit a session proposal by <strong>this Monday 14 November</strong> to have it considered for the programme.</p>
<p>Finally don't forget that <a href="http://linux.conf.au/">LCA (Linux.conf.au) is the week immediately following Drupal Downunder</a>.</p>

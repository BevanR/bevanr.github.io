    <p>I spend a lot of time on the read-write web.  I work on a lot of large complicated documents on the web.  I often copy text from forms in my web browser to a text editor that is easy to use.  I am sick of using basic text editors that web browsers have.  This however is a less than ideal workflow.</p>
<p>I would love to have my <a href="http://macromates.com/">favorite text editor</a> embedded in my <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html">favorite web browser</a>.  Something like this:<br>

    <p>The new year (this post is a little late!) has brought me new opportunities and some new roles;</p>
<ul>
<li>As of 21 December 2009, I am a front end Drupal software engineer at <strong>NowPublic</strong> Technologies Inc, aka <a href="http://www.nowpublic.com/">NowPublic.com</a> (Clarity Digital Group and <a href="http://www.examiner.com/">Examiner.com</a>).</li>
<li>As of 3 March 2010, I am a <a href="http://association.drupal.org/about/staff">permanent member on the staff</a> of the <strong><a href="http://association.drupal.org/">Drupal Association</a></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.nowpublic.com/"><img align="right" alt="NowPublic, Crowd Powered Media" src="http://static.nowpublic.net/graphics/sites/all/themes/nova/default/images/logo-header.png"></a></p>
<h2>New job at NowPublic</h2>
<p>At NowPublic I work on front end theming and customizations for NowPublic.com and <a href="http://www.nowpublic.com/scans">Scan</a> — a realtime twitter and social media tracker for NowPublic.com, Examiner.com, <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/">WashingtonExaminer.com</a>, <a href="http://www.sfexaminer.com/">SFexaminer.com</a> and <a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/">The Vancouver Sun</a>.</p>
<p>Currently I am the skeleton dev team that maintains NowPublic.com, while the rest of the NowPublic dev team works on the <a href="http://acquia.com/resources/webinars/peek-behind-scenes-%E2%80%93-how-clarity-media-moving-examinercom-drupal-7">Examiner.com migration to Drupal 7</a>.  Though I spend most of my dev time in the depths of the javascript and theme layer of Scan.</p>
<p>One of the most exciting things about this job is that I am able to work with <a href="http://drupal.org/profile/companies/NowPublic">an amazing team of developers</a> including some other <a href="http://civicactions.com/">CivicActions</a> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/civicactions-alumni">alumni</a>, whom I respect and seek to learn from.  Such as <a href="http://drupal.org/user/9446">chx</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/user/14572">kkaefer</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/user/29191">douggreen</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/user/9034">Morbus Iff</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/profile/companies/NowPublic">many others</a>.</p>

<h3>Vancouver</h3>
<p>The new job at NowPublic saw me relocate to Vancouver for two and a half months, from just after <a href="http://drupal.geek.nz/blog/drupalsouth-wellington-success">DrupalSouth Wellington</a></p>
<p> at the end of January, until <a href="http://sf2010.drupal.org/">DrupalCon San Francisco</a>, this week.</p>
<p>Vancouver has been astounding!  Some highlights of my first trip ever to Canada and my stay in Vancouver include;</p>
<ul>
<li>meeting fun people and making great friends</li>
<li>the <a href="http://www.vancouver2010.com/">winter olympics</a>, especially watching Canada;
<ul>
<li>win the first ever olympic gold on home soil</li>
<li>win more gold medals than any country in any winter olympics ever</li>
<li>defeat the USA in the ice hockey finals; a heart-stopping match with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_goal">a golden-goal by Canada's favourite player – Sidney Crosby – in overtime</a></li>
<li>celebrate unreservedly and fanatically — even as crazily as I remember Argentines celebrating World cup football match victories on the streets of Buenos Aires in 2006</li>
</ul>

  </p></li>
<li>meeting the <a href="http://www.winterolympics.co.nz/">NZ winter olympic team</a> on the streets of Vancouver, by accident</li>
<li>snowboarding at <a href="http://www.mtbaker.us/">Mt Baker</a>, <a href="http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/">Whistler-Blackcomb</a> and <a href="http://www.grousemountain.com/">Grouse Mountain</a></li>
<li>cycling around <a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Stanley+park&amp;sll=49.283372,-123.122749&amp;sspn=0.045631,0.057592&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=Stanley+Park&amp;hnear=Stanley+Park,+Vancouver,+BC&amp;ll=49.301509,-123.156824&amp;spn=0.044215,0.090294&amp;z=14">Stanley park</a></li>
<li>visiting <a href="http://maps.google.ca/?q=Victoria,+BC,+Canada">Victoria</a>, now one of my favourite cities</li>
</ul>

<p>This Friday 16 April I depart Vancouver for San Francisco, where I will stay with the Clarity Digital Group developer team at Westin Hotel Market street for 8 days, for the <a href="http://sf2010.drupal.org/conference/core-developer-summit">Drupal core developer summit</a>, <a href="http://sf2010.drupal.org/">DrupalCon SF</a>, code sprints, meetings, social events, and a Drupal Association retreat.</p>
<p>Finally, on April 26 (after losing April 25 to the date line) I will arrive home to Christchurch NZ to stay indefinitely.  It will be exactly 8 months since my wife and I departed Christchurch for DrupalCon Paris and a journey across 5 continents.  I am looking forward to having a home (when we find and rent one!) and our bed back.</p>
<h2>Drupal Association</h2>
<p><a href="http://association.drupal.org/user/466" title="Permanent Member of the Drupal Association General Assembly"><img align="left" src="http://drupal.geek.nz/files/DA-assembly-120.png" alt="Permanent Member of the Drupal Association General Assembly"></a></p>
<p>Being elected onto the Drupal Association's General Assembly was largely unexpected and came as a surprise to me.  I have been a core part of the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/drupalcon-asia-pacific-organizers-dcapo">DrupalCon Asia-Pacific Organisers (DCAPO) group on groups.drupal.org</a> since it started in September 2009 and collaborated a little with <a href="http://association.drupal.org/user/Cary_Gordon">Cary Gordon (Drupal Association Board, Director of Events)</a> over that time.  Cary asked me to join the Drupal Association to help centralise international DrupalCon coordination efforts (as per <a href="http://association.drupal.org/node/342">the events plan</a>) and provide the association with a more internationalised perspective.</p>
<p>It is still early days at the association, but my goal (as per <a href="http://association.drupal.org/election/node/133">my application</a>) at the Drupal Association is to empower a team to organise and run a DrupalCon somewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, hopefully around 2011.  There are some ideas and projects at the association to do with scholarships and mini-conferences — but I will save that for another time, when it is ready.</p>

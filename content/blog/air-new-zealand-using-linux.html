    <p><a href="http://www.airnewzealand.com/gateway.jsp">Air New Zealand</a>'s in-flight entertainment system runs Linux. Unfortunately the layer of software that Air NZ has deployed on top of Linux is buggy and I noticed at least twice in one 3-hour flight that it crashed, causing Linux to reboot. (This is what led me to discover the systems run Linux.)<br>
Watching Linux boot on the seat-back console screen was fun. And it was nice to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux">Tux the Penguin</a> about the airline.</p>

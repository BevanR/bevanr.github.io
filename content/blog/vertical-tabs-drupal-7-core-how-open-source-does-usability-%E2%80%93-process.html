    <p>Vertical tabs are finally in Drupal core!</p>

<p>A week ago <a href="http://drupal.org/user/24967">Angie "webchick" Byron</a> <a href="http://drupal.org/cvs?commit=195696">committed a large patch</a> from <a href="http://drupal.org/node/323112">#323112 Vertical Tabs</a> to Drupal 7 core.  This change is quite possibly the most significant usability enhancement to Drupal 7 to date.  Two of the three formal usability tests did usability testing with vertical tabs and <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/12447">reported</a> <a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/usability-testing-university-baltimore">positively</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: <a href="http://drupal.org/user/61114">Rob Loach</a> has created a patch to implement <a href="http://drupal.org/node/439798">vertical tabs on the node-type form</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: See other issues about <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?issue_tags=vertical%20tabs">vertical tabs in Drupal core </a>.</strong></p>

<p>What is more interesting about this however, is the process, time and effort that it took to get this change into Drupal core.  It all started over a year ago, well before <a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/">DrupalCon Boston 2008</a> even before <a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-6.0">Drupal 6 had a stable release</a>.  The <a href="http://drupal.org/node/190946">discussion around part of that patch</a> goes back as far as November 2007!  Along the way countless people have been involved in many discussions, worked on heaps of mockups, lots of prototypes, and loads of code.</p>

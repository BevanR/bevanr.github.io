    <p>Gabor blogged about how <a href="http://hojtsy.hu/blog/2007-dec-24/ies4osx-saved-drupal-hu-christmas">IEs4OSX saved drupal.hu</a>.  I was impressed with his review so I tried it out myself.  Now I don't have to boot up greedy 'ol parallels everyday just to update my hours in Quickbooks (It even runs activeX controls)!  :)</p>
<p>I definitely recommend <a href="http://www.kronenberg.org/ies4osx/">IEs4OSX</a>.</p>

    <p><a href="http://drupalsouth.net.nz/organisers">Together with some friends and colleagues</a> we have been working hard to organise, finalize and publish details of what will be the two most important days for Drupal in New Zealand:</p>
<h3>DrupalSouth: The New Zealand Drupal Event for 2008</h3>
<p><a href="http://drupalsouth.net.nz" style="float:right"><img src="http://drupalsouth.net.nz/sites/drupalsouth/files/lightfantastic_logo.png" alt="DrupalSouth logo: The DrupliKiwiFruit"></a> <a href="http://drupalsouth.net.nz">DrupalSouth</a> is the New Zealand Drupal Event for 2008.  DrupalSouth will bring NZ's Drupal community together for the first nation-wide Drupal event and the first ever Drupal camp in NZ.</p>
<p>DrupalSouth runs for two days in the first weekend of November, starting at 9:30 am on Saturday 1st November and concluding at 6 pm on Sunday 2nd November 2008.  The morning of each day will be filled with presentations, while the afternoons will be open to less formal talks, discussions, demonstrations, tutorials and hacking.</p>
<p>I will be presenting on <a href="http://drupalsouth.net.nz/session/google-maps-in-drupal-the-hub-map">Google Maps in Drupal; The Hub Map</a>, in which I will showcase <a href="http://hub.witness.org/map#full-screen">the Hub Map</a>, and talk about implementing Google maps mashups in Drupal.</p>

    <p>I have just one simple prediction for Drupal in 2008;</p>
<blockquote><p>Drupal becomes to websites and the website-producing industry, what Linux is to webservers and the web-hosting industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>Realistically this will probably take well into 2009 for this to be effective to the extent that linux, but the foundations for this are already laid and I believe that with the current momentum, it's just time before my prediction becomes true.</p>

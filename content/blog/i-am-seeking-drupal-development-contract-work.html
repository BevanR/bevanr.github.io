<p><strong>I am currently available for Drupal development contract work.</strong></p>
<p>I am interested in contracts or projects of any width, height or length.  I am especially interested in projects that (roughly in order);</p>
<ul>
<li>are socially conscious</li>
<li>have other talented and experienced Drupal developers to work and grow with</li>
<li>compensate at reasonable-to-good rates</li>
</ul>
<p>I am only available to work virtually, since I am based in Thailand (UTC+7) till Christmas, then Wellington, New Zealand (UTC+13) till about late January, then probably Christchurch, NZ after that.</p>
<p>I'm highly experienced with Drupal and many contrib modules, contributing to and interacting with the community, Drupal module development, debugging and front end development â€“ especially CSS, Javascript and efficient, maintainable and scalable Drupal themes.  I am also very skilled and experienced at mentoring less-experienced Drupal developers, planning &amp; architecting Drupal-based solutions from wireframes and/or specifications and putting into effect best practices for Drupal development teams.</p>
<p><a href="http://drupal.geek.nz/">My blog</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/user/49989/track">my Drupal.org profile is my certification</a>.  <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/user/6860/track">My groups.drupal.org profile</a> shows further involvement in the Drupal community, such as <a href="http://drupalsouth.net.nz/">DrupalSouth Christchurch 2008</a>, <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/26217">DrupalSouth Wellington 2010</a>, <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/drupalcon-asiapacific-regional-organising-group">DrupalCon Asia-Pacific</a>, Usability group and UX team.  I presented 4 sessions at 3 of the last 4 DrupalCons on <a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/session/scalable-theming-theming-100s-node-types-cck-fields-and-views">Scalable</a>/<a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/advanced-theming-techniques">Advanced Theming</a>, <a href="http://paris2009.drupalcon.org/session/jquery-designers-and-themers">jQuery</a>, and <a href="http://paris2009.drupalcon.org/session/how-contribute-drupal">contributing to Drupal</a>.</p>
<p>I have contributed patches that were committed to Drupal core.  I have contributed a few small modules, co-maintained a few others and more extensively maintained and contributed to the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/salesforce">Salesforce module</a>.</p>

    <p>My first spam by snail mail:<br>
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/b.rudge/DomainRegistryOfAmerica"><img src="http://www.civicactions.com/sites/civicactions.com/files/IMG_5535.jpg" alt="letterhead of letter from 'Domain Registry of America'"><br>
more photos and full letter</a></p>
<p>What's up with that? Has '<a href="http://droa.com/">Domain Registry of America</a>' got enough funding to do this seriously?  Is anyone else getting spammed from their virtual life by snail mail?</p>

    <p>The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/uts">Usability Testing Suite</a> is <a href="http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/uts-6.x-1.0-beta1.tar.gz">in Beta</a>!  Google Summer of Code student <a href="http://drupal.org/user/214218">Jimmy "boombatower" Berry</a> has been coding hard and fast all this great usability testing tool.<br>
The Usability Testing Suite is intended to be used for remote 'guerilla' usability testing.  Currently it allows a usability test designer/engineer to create a study with a bunch of tasks, and invite participants to attempt the task, whilst remotely capturing data about the pages / urls the participant visited, the forms they submitted, what data was entered, and allows the participant to log typed live feedback as they go.  More data capturers are planned (outside the scope of SoC) that will make this tool a really valuable asset to the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/usability">Drupal Usability community</a>.<br>

    <p>NZ government is negotiating a trade act that will impact your civil liberties.  And they are doing it behind our backs — in secret!</p>
<blockquote><p>"<acronym title="Anti Counterfeiting Trade Agreement">ACTA</acronym> is a controversial international treaty that impacts digital rights and is being negotiated in secret meetings.  ACTA is proposed as a plurilateral trade agreement for establishing international standards on intellectual property rights enforcement.  It is being negotiated between the US, Canada, Japan, the European Union, South Korea, Mexico, Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand.  Unfortunately, the negotiations have extended beyond trade and physical counterfeiting to potentially cover non-commercial infringement of copyright material by ordinary citizens and issues of digital rights management." — <a href="http://publicacta.org.nz/acta-and-publicacta">PublicACTA.org.nz</a></p></blockquote>
<p>As well as the violating our democratic principles, and the deceitful name of the treaty, ACTA aims to bring back <a href="http://creativefreedom.org.nz/forum/topic.php?id=224">the "draconian" (to quote prime minister John Keys) S92a laws</a> we fought hard against last year with <a href="http://drupal.geek.nz/blog/internet-blackout-nz">the NZ Internet Blackout</a>.</p>

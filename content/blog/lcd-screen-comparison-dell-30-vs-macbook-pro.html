    <p>While checking out <a href="http://www.raincitystudios.com/blog/spread-firefox-site-deployment">Raincity Studio's drupal work</a> on <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/">SpreadFirefox.com</a> I found myself becoming agitated by the bright orange color palette.  I <a href="http://www.raincitystudios.com/blog/spread-firefox-site-deployment#comment-5403">whined a little</a> about the design then realized my monitor is partially to blame.  The model I have of Dell's 30" LCD monitor (<a href="http://www1.ap.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/3008wfp?c=nz&amp;cs=nzdhs1&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs">Here's the newer model</a>) has a whopping 1:1000 contrast ratio.  Is that what makes firefox-orange so damned bright?</p>
<p>In <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/b.rudge/Dell30LCDScreenVsMacBookProScreen">these photos</a> I've tried (not completely successfully) to capture the difference between the Dell monitor and th MacBook Pro monitor:<br>

<p>I've already tried adjusting adjusting with Mac OS X but couldn't improve the orange much.  Adjusting brightness helps a little too but not enough.  I haven't bothered trying out the Dell CD that came with the monitor as I assumed Apple's calibrator would be easier to use.  Also the CD is probably only for windows -- although I should probably check it out.  Has anyone found Dell software 'drivers' useful on Mac OS X?</p>

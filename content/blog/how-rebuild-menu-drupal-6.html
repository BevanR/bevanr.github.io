    <p>To rebuild the menu in Drupal 6 you have to go to admin/build/modules.<br>
In drupal 5 the menu is cached in the <code>cache_menu</code> table, so it is easy to invoke a menu-rebuild by emptying the table with a simple mysql command like <code>TRUNCATE cache_menu;</code>.  (I have a handy script that empties all tables starting with <code>cache_</code>).<br>

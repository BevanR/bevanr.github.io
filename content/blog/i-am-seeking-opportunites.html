    <p>I am seeking career opportunities.</p>
<p>My ideal client/employer would;</p>
<ul>
<li>have a mission related to creating fantastic software or a service.</li>
<li>have me work primarily with;
<ol>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>a framework, language or technology that is new to me.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>value it's team over everything else.</li>
<li>contribute to open source.</li>
<li>be a not for profit.</li>
<li>be making a difference.</li>
<li>be in Auckland so I can sit next to my colleagues.  (I usually work remotely.  I will not relocate.)</li>
</ul>
<p>That is a big wish-list, but I am happy to compromise!  :)</p>
<p>I have worked on Drupal projects for the last 7 years.  Most of that time for amazing Drupal shops; <a href="http://civicactions.com/">CivicActions</a>, <a href="" http:="" palantir.net="" "="">Palantir.net</a>, <a href="http://previousnext.com.au/">PreviousNext</a> and others (<a href="http://drupal.geek.nz/cv">see my CV</a>).  My skill, seniority and knowledge is highly valuable to Drupal companies &amp; projects.  Indeed I can get well compensated working with Drupal.  And Drupal is a fantastic piece of softwareâ€”a great choice for most websites.  And most of all, Drupal has an incredible community of contributers and collaborators.</p>
<p>But it is time for me to move on;</p>
<p>I am becoming more and more curious what other web frameworks, languages and tools are like.  I want to learn new things and tackle problems of a different type.  I love Javascript.  I am drawn to building web applications instead of web sites.  I want to refine my user interaction design skills.</p>
<p>So <a href="http://drupal.geek.nz/contact">I am seeking career opportunities</a>!  :)</p>
<p>I am currently freelancing until I find the right opportunity.  So please <a href="http://drupal.geek.nz/contact">contact me</a> about short term projects too.</p>

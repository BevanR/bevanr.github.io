    <p>Online retailers <a href="http://www.bwmsnow.co.nz">BWMsnow</a> and <a href="http://www.skategear.co.nz">SKATEgear</a> require the professional services of a Drupal vendor or developer to take over the maintenance and future development their websites.</p>

<p>BWMsnow is NZ's largest online retailer of snowboard gear and has been operating for more than 4 years internationally, focussing more heavily on the NZ market in recent years.  BWMsnow was NZ's only online retailer of snowboard gear until recently.  BWMsnow is a NZ limited company which continues to grows significantly every selling season (March to June).</p>

<p>SKATEgear is considerably younger and smaller but growing very quickly.  SKATEgear is a NZ limited company.  There are 2 individuals that operate SKATEgear jointly, one of whom operates BWMsnow solely.</p>

<p>The websites are running in a multisite configuration on Drupal 5.7, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/ecommerce">ecommerce 3.4</a>, 25 'vanilla' contrib modules, 10 custom or customized contrib modules (customizations are clearly documented) and a custom theme and theme variant.  Paypal is the merchant gateway for credit cards.  Payments are also accepted by bank transfer.</p>

<p>Currently the sites are operating smoothly with no major issues and are hosted on a drupal-optimized server in Christchurch managed by <a href="http://egressive.com/">Egressive</a>, where a subversion <acronym title="Source Code Control">SCC</acronym> repository is also provided and used.  Every now and then issues arise or enhancements are requested.  The clients need assurance that the sites will always work as expected, that enhancements/bug-fixes won't break any existing features and to know the total cost of maintenance and development.  An established QA team and/or process will be a significant advantage.  Some enhancements that currently need research, estimation and possibly development are;

</p><ul>
  <li>Charge for shipping</li>
  <li>Enable shipping to Australia</li>
  <li>Restore and fix <a href="http://drupal.org/project/flash_gallery">flash gallery module</a> for image galleries</li>
  <li>Enhancements to the cart and checkout steps</li>
</ul><p></p>

<p>I developed the sites and have maintained them.  I am no longer able to continue meeting the growing needs of these growing businesses due to other commitments.  I maintain a good personal and business relationship with the individuals involved.  I will be advising BWMsnow and SKATEgear on vendors and developers where possible and will help the successful vendor/developer to orientate themselves with contacts, access, the website, configuration, database, code base, customizations and other nuances.</p>

<p>Extensive experience with Drupal and a portfolio of Drupal work are expected.  Experience with ecommerce module, paypal APIs or other ecommerce sites is a significant advantage.  Vendors/developers in Christchurch are preferred, but not required.  An established QA team and/or process will be a significant advantage.  Excellent communication, project and client management skills are required.</p>

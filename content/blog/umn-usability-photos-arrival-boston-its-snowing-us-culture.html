    <p>I arrived in Boston yesterday afternoon, absolutely exhausted after Usability testing at UMN -- which was amazing.  See the <a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/session/report-formal-usability-testing-university-minnesota-libraries">report at 9am on Monday</a> to hear why.  It was snowing heavily here this morning.  Today I need to prepare for <a href="http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/session/contributing-usability-drupal-guide-contributing-review-usability-contributions">my presentation on Scalable Theming</a> and my parts of the Usability presentation, and try open another US bank account.</p>
<p>Here's my photoblog <del>to date</del>:</p>

<p>A few NEW cultural oddities I've noticed in the US since my last visit 5 years ago:</p>
<ul>
<li>Airport pager: "The security threat level... is orange" -- talk about<br>
fear-mongering.  No need for foreign terrorism in the US -- the local authorities are terrorizing plenty enough here!</li>
<li>Control-culture doesn't seem to be so severe this trip but is still grating.  I think that's more to do with the people and places I'm mingling with though.</li>
<li>You can't seem to fill up a bottle with water anywhere.  They seem to be getting the idea of 'being green' with recycle bins and signs to conserve hand-drying paper in the toilets and not leave the tap dripping, yet it's difficult NOT to go through several styrofoam, paper or plastic cups, bottles, plates and fast-food trays per day.  I wonder how effective the recycling actually is here?  Given the amount of extremely cheap "recyclable" materials consumed, and the fact that these materials usually aren't economically worth recycling, I suspect very little of it is actually recycled.  Even where recycle bins are present.  Meaning all the recycle bins do is make you feel less guilty about being a polluting consumer.
<ul>
<li>Most annoyingly of all for me, I can't fill up a bottle with tap water anywhere except a public bathroom, which 'feels' unhygenic, although probably isn't.</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
